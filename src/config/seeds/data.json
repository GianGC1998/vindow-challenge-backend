      "body": "Leave a Comment\nContent note: This post addresses the topic of childhood sexual trauma. It does not go into detail; rather, the focus is on the healing challenges that we face when we have experiences that are hard to talk about  as well as how to overcome those challenges.\nStress creates tension in both the mind and body, and that tension, when sustained over time, can result in symptoms like chronic pain.\nA common source of sustained stress is: The life experiences that are hard to talk about. When part of our life experience is hard to talk about, we feel alone with it and we hold in our feelings about it, which creates tension and pressure in our mind-body system.\nOften, the reason that things are hard to talk about is that our early life and cultural conditioning have taught us not to expect empathy or understanding from others when it comes to certain topics and situations. So, we protect ourselves by holding it in. But as a long-term strategy, holding it in takes a toll on the mind and body.\nThe path to healing is not a straight line. Its a complex dance. Because building safety requires us to integrate two seemingly opposing needs: the need to honor our authentic experience and be a true ally to ourselves, and the need to preserve the social connections that we require to keep us safe in the world.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nIm going to share a little bit about my personal experience with something thats hard to talk about  something that, to be honest, Im still finding the language for. By writing about this, Im not only hoping to help others find their way to internal safety and integration; Im building another brick in my own road to safety and integration as well.\nWhen building safety around something thats hard to talk about, I find it helpful to approach things layer by layer. When I began processing these experiences many years ago, I started with the inner-most layer of disclosure: I first began writing about it in the privacy of my own journal, then speaking about it in the company of a trusted therapist, then gradually with a few carefully chosen friends and later in support groups.\nAnd when sharing more publicly, I find it useful to address the topic layer by layer, starting with the outermost layer. So today, Im going to simply state that my hard to talk about issue has to do with felt experiences of sexual boundary violation in childhood, involving my parents.\nBut instead of getting into the specifics, Im going to start with the outer layers of what makes this hard to talk about  as well as some of the\nmethods that have helped me process and integrate whats hard to talk about.\nRegardless of the specifics of your own life experience, I hope you find something validating and supportive in these words.\nWhat Makes This Experience Hard To Talk About?\n1 My desire to protect my parents\nIve had a close relationship with my parents my whole life. Its changed a lot over the last ten years since confronting this hard to talk about issue with them. But I continue to be close with them and I love them. I have a desire to protect them from outside judgement.\n2 My desire to be liked by my parents\nI also dont want my parents to see me as responsible for potential outside judgment towards them.\n3 My desire to protect those who might see me as a role model\nWriting publicly about sexual boundary violations from parents is a hard thing to do. Many, understandably, dont feel safe to do so. So, when anyone speaks or writes about this topic, they are also speaking for many others who feel voiceless. And because there are so few who feel empowered to speak or write about this topic, each of our voices holds a lot of weight.\nI love my parents and I choose to maintain a close connection with them. Thats the path that feels right for me. However, its not the path thats right for everyone. Yet, the hierarchical society that we live in places a lot of pressure on adult children to love and stay connected with their elders  no matter how it impacts their mental, emotional, spiritual or physical wellbeing.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nMy fear is that, if I write about my healing journey authentically, others might think that they also need to stay connected with their parents  even if its not whats best for them.\n4 My desire to protect myself from those who might feel betrayed\nRelated to the above, I worry that some readers might feel betrayed if they interpret my story as a prescription to love and stay connected with ones parents, even if its not whats best for you.\nAnd of course, I worry that my own parents and other family members might feel betrayed by me writing about my experience of sexual boundary violation, given the level of cultural taboo and shame that surrounds the topic. While its not my intention to bring attention to my parents, writing about my own experience of violation inherently implicates them.\n5 My desire to protect myself from emotional mis-attunement\nMost people have strong emotional reactions to this topic, compounded by the fact that its culturally taboo to talk about. Even the mention of sexual boundary violation can trigger peoples innate threat response in the form of fight, flight, freeze or appease.\nAnd this is understandable. As a society, we havent been given a safe space to process our own individual feelings about this issue. And we cant hold space for each others feelings when we havent been given the space to process our own.\nWhen I share my story, responses from others often mis-attune with my own emotional reality in these two ways:\nunderreaction, which mis-attunes with my need to have my hurts acknowledged.\nheightened reaction, which mis-attunes with my need stay connected with the nuances and complexities of my own emotional experience.\n6 Lack of nuanced language\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nBecause of the social taboos that prevent us from talking freely about this topic, we as a society lack nuanced language with which to discuss it. As with all life experiences, sexual boundary violations within families exist on a spectrum ranging from energetic harm to emotional harm to physical harm, etc. There is endless variety in our experiences, yet we lack a shared language and understanding with which to talk about it.\n7 Murky memory\nWhen something is hard to talk about, we dont get to process it with others while its happening. And this is one of many factors that make traumatic experiences difficult to remember with clarity. The lack of clarity in our memory dovetails with internal and external pressures to deny, minimize or forget these hard to talk about experiences. Ive written more about this\n.\nHow Do We Heal When Its Hard To Talk About?\nIf we want to relieve the pressure that our hard to talk about experiences place on our mind and body  sustained pressure that can manifest in stress symptoms  we ne",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nOver the years, I remain astonished at how similar our relationship aspirations are. Most of us, after a period of experimentation and the disappointment of hook-ups, are looking for a longer, deeper love. Conversely, how we handle relationship discord is also very consistent. There are not too many varianceseither we put effort into communication and change, or we just call it quits and move on.\nAs a marriage counselor, I rarely speak with couples who are doing well. And while I occasionally play referee with couples who have already decided to separate, its oftentimes too late. My sweet spot is in that place where one or both partners have become disillusioned with their relationship, but are still connected to the point where they are willing to try to make it work.\nAnd it is herein the hurt and heartachethat things get really rough. Because working through our pain and feelings of betrayal is deeply personal. Our partners act as a mirror to our subconscious self. When we are cherished and respected, it reinforces our positive self-image and self-perception. When we are treated poorly, the well-known tale of Im still not good enough bursts to the surface, shattering any positive feelings of our own self-worth.\nA therapist walks a tightrope. On one hand, fostering conversation, analysis, forgiveness, and understanding about past wrongs, and on the other, protecting my clients from emotional devastation during the process. Personally, I am very, very protectiveI have yet to see anything positive ever come out of an emotional street fight between couples. I proceed with extreme caution, but I proceed never-the-less.\nWhy? Because at the root of relationship dysfunction and heartbreak lay one of two truths. First, that in reality, we are incompatible. Our goals, desires, personalities, values, and most importantlywillingness to changeare just too far apart to overcome. There is room in life for such a thing to happen. Not everybody can co-exist in intimacy together.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nAnd the second truth is that we actually share the same desires, vision, values, and needsbut just dont know how to get there. We dont know how to talk to each other without fighting. We share the same home yet feel alone. We share each others bodies, yet feel unloved or unfulfilled. This is most of us at some point during our relationship.\nTo discern your relationship truth, you need to find outpracticallywhere your partner stands on the issues most important to you, without stirring the emotional pot of guilt, blame, anger, and criticism.\nI recently worked with a woman who was hurting. Her boyfriend of many years whom she loved dearly wasnt living up to her relationship expectations in some important areas. She found out he was connecting (flirting) with other women on social media. He felt emotionally distant, to the point of not caring anymore. And when she needed his help, she felt he was giving it out of obligation, and not love.\nWhen she focused on the negative, and how she wasnt being treated according to her desire, the choice of leaving him was clear. But before she walked out the door, I encouraged her to have a more rational conversation, sans the feelings of hurt and blame.\nYou may want to ask him, in a serious way: Id like more intimacy with you  a more connected, loving, committed relationship. Currently, I see we are having some challenges. Is what I want the same as what you want?\nMeaning  without shame or guilt, just state what is going on, and how you feel, and ask in a sincere way if he is willing to change. What would that change look like? Does he need anything from you? Perhaps, you are not showing up in a way that satisfies him?\nAnd while I dont believe you must bend over backward to satisfy his every fantasy, perhaps what he is missing is something that you are willing to do. You never know unless you are willing to ask.\nWhen we are able to push away our pain and disappointment, and really connect with our partners innermost desires and goals, we may be very surprised that they are similar to our own. And, that the path to harmony, peace, love, and trust is not as far away as it may seem.\n",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nAt the beginning of 2005, I entered into a relationship with a boy. At the end of 2010, he ended it. Hed started a relationship with somebody else and, having given the matter careful consideration, decided he preferred what his paramour had to offer him.\nHe presented this information to me as a fait accompli. There was to be no discussion, no negotiation. It was his decision to make, he said, and he had made it. There was nothing I could do to change his mind.\nSo that was it: betrayed, blindsided and booted out of his life in a nanosecond. He left the following morning and we have never spoken since.\nThe shock was obliterative, unbearably monstrous. I could not conceive at any level  emotional, logical, psychological  how someone I trusted and believed was innately good, innately decent, was also capable of behaving like an adulterous cad; that he was, in fact, a cad.\nI was spat out, catapulted onto new, unwelcome terrain. A blackness descended upon my life. He had destroyed everything I knew to be true. It will be OK, he assured me that night. It wasnt. It wasnt for many years. Every day was a struggle to stay alive.\n2011 was my year of magical thinking.\n\nA single person is missing, and the whole world is empty.\nHe had been planning it for a while, he said. For months, actually.\nThe opposite of love isnt hate, its indifference. Those who love us sometimes desire to wound us. But if someone is indifferent, what they demonstrate is a total lack of care.\nThe analytical mind turns to questions of why. Theyve gone  and what we need most of all to understand is why? Not why me, necessarily. But why this?\nI wanted to know what had been going through his mind. How he justified what he had done, or didnt. I may not have known everything about him, but I did know something. I couldnt reconcile the different parts of him.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nYet I never wished for an excoriating confrontation. The scale of my devastation meant no explanation he could offer would satisfy me. And I doubted he even knew himself. His deeper motives would be his burden to carry; they didnt have to be mine as well.\nAll the while, I missed him still. Not the person hed turned out to be, but the person I thought he was.\nAnd in the assessment of what had happened, there was little hope of lessening the agony.\n\nWe imagined we knew everything the other thought, even when we did not necessarily want to know it, but in fact, I have come to see, we knew not the smallest fraction of what there was to know.\nYou see the pity in the eyes of well-meaning people. There but for the grace of God go I. But there is judgment there, too. And offers of help, sincerely made, mask a curiosity. You really didnt know? Or: being so openly devastated makes you look like a victim. Or: there must be something about you which is easy to leave behind.\nAny attempt to put a brick wall around the overwhelming sense of annihilation I felt, was useless. I felt that way for a very long time. It was all-consuming.\nI wasnt the man he wanted. He wanted someone else. It was unimaginable, for all I wanted was him and I thought I already had him.\n\nIt was in fact the ordinary nature of everything preceding the event that prevented me from truly believing it had happened, absorbing it, incorporating it, getting past it. I recognize now there was nothing unusual in this: confronted with sudden disaster we all focus on how unremarkable the circumstances were in which the unthinkable occurred, the clear blue sky from which the plane fell, the routine errand that ended on the shoulder with the car in flames, the swings where the children were playing as usual when the rattlesnake struck from the ivy.\nEight months after he left, I cried properly for the first time. I had been making it into work, but I was barely eating and I was barely sleeping, and it was three AM in the kitchen and I sat down next to the ironing board which had been standing right in the middle of the room for months now, and I could see no future for myself which didnt involve suffering.\nHow could he do this to me?\nYet I wasnt the prime motivating factor in his behaviour. I had been once, maybe. But not really.\nSome people who suffer betrayal and abandonment blame themselves. It makes a sort of sense to do so. There is, after all, no more personal a rejection. But I didnt find myself afflicted by that particular pathology. I preferred the view that some people are more prone to those sorts of behaviours than others, that a lot of what people do stems from their childhood, or from compulsions learned elsewhere.\nWhat I couldnt come to terms with was having let one of those people into my life. I never once felt disgusting. What I felt was disgust.\n\nThey lost concentration. After a year I could read headlines, I was told by a friend whose husband had died three years before.\nI look back and think how much time I lost. All the books I could have read. All the stuff I could have travelled to see. I was no longer paying for him, so I had money to burn.\nYet I couldnt concentrate on anything other than him. That he likely wasnt thinking of me at all made no difference. I knew the folly of pining for an absent figure. Why go on loving someone who doesnt love you back? I did it anyway.\nI started to see how little he had given me of his life, how carefully managed the information he made available to me had been. This somehow made an already dire predicament desparate.\nI had intertwined my life with his. I just didnt see his reluctance to intertwine his with mine.\n\nPeople who have recently lost someone have a certain look, recognizable maybe only to those who have seen that look on their own faces. I have noticed it on my face and I notice it now on others. The look is one of extreme vulnerability, nakedness, openness. It is the look of someone who walks from the ophthalmologists office into the bright daylight with dilated eyes, or of someone who wears glasses and is suddenly made to take them off. These people who have lost someone look naked because they think themselves invisible. I myself felt invisible for a period of time, incorporeal.\nI resented the unilateral nature of his conduct, and the enduring psychological problem it created for me. Relationships require reciprocity. In the absence of reciprocity there is only selfishness.\nI thought we were a team. I thought we were in partnership. In fact, he was secretly building a new life, apparently in full view. I just hadnt noticed.\nI thought we operated in unison. In fact, we were two stories running alongside one another which never managed to align or converge.\nI remained reluctant to condemn him. He hadnt set out to destroy me, I told myself, or even to hurt me. He had behaved badly, but he wasnt a bad person. But I came to realise that what he did was cruel. And it made him look like a user, like someone who extracts what they want from a person, then moves o",

In this blog post, well explore virtual production and why it matters to filmmakers and audiences alike.\nWhat is Virtual Production?\nVirtual production is a filmmaking technique that uses real-time computer graphics, motion capture, and other advanced technologies to create digital sets, characters, and environments in real-time. This technology allows filmmakers to visualize and manipulate their shots in real-time, enabling them to make creative decisions on the fly. This reduces the time and cost of production.\nVirtual production is often confused with visual effects (VFX); the latter involves adding computer-generated images or other products to footage already shot. However, virtual production is a broader concept encompassing various techniques. These techniques are used throughout the filmmaking process, from pre-production to post-production. It involves using technology to create a virtual version of the film before its even shot, allowing filmmakers to plan and experiment with their shots in a digital environment. This process can save time & money while also giving filmmakers greater creative control over the final product.\nBenefits of Virtual Production\nOne of the key benefits of virtual production is that it allows a video production studio to capture performances in real-time rather than composite them later. For example, instead of filming actors against a green screen and adding a digital background in post-production, virtual production allows the actors to perform in a fully realized digital environment, with virtual sets and characters they can interact with in real-time. This can result in more natural performances and a more immersive viewing experience.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nVirtual production is still a relatively\nnew film technology\nArc Studios.\nFor example, Disney, also a video production studio, used virtual production extensively for producing The Mandalorian, the first live-action Star Wars series. Both these shows used a combination of real-time rendering, motion capture, and other advanced techniques to create a wholly realized digital world that was integrated seamlessly with the live-action footage.\nOverall, virtual production is a powerful tool for a video production studio that can help them to create more immersive & engaging films while also saving time and money. As technology continues to evolve, well likely see more & more filmmakers adopting virtual production techniques in their work.\nWhats VFX?\nVFX (Visual Effects) in the film refers to the digital manipulation of live-action footage or the creation of entirely new computer-generated imagery (CGI) to enhance the visuals of a movie. VFX is used to create realistic and fantastical environments, creatures, characters, and objects and is a vital component of modern filmmaking. VFX can create anything from a simple wire removal to a full-blown action.\nTypes of VFX\nVFX can be broadly categorized into two types: 2D & 3D. 2D VFX involves manipulating footage or images in two dimensions: compositing, rotoscoping, and matte painting. 3D VFX, on the other hand, consists in creating and manipulating objects and environments in three dimensions using software such as Maya, 3DS Max, or Houdini.\nThe process of creating VFX begins with pre-production planning and storyboarding. Once the script is finalized, major studios like Arc Studios have a VFX team to work closely with the director and cinematographer to plan and execute shots that require VFX. During production, VFX supervisors and technicians capture data and measurements for post-production.\nPost-production is where the bulk of VFX work occurs. VFX artists use specialized software to create and manipulate visual elements and integrate them with live-action footage. This process includes 3D modeling, texturing, lighting, animation, & compositing. The final result is a seamless integration of live-action footage & digital elements that enhance the films storytelling.\nVFX is an essential component of modern filmmaking that a video production studio will use to tell stories previously impossible to realize on-screen. The use of VFX has opened up new creative possibilities and pushed the boundaries of what can be achieved visually in the film.\nVirtual Production and Green Screen\nVirtual production and green screens are different. Although both techniques use computer-generated imagery (CGI) to create a fictional environment, their approach and technology differ.\nGreen screen, also known as chroma keying, is a method used in film and video production to replace the background of a shot with a different image or video footage. This is achieved by filming the actors in front of a green or blue screen, which can then be replaced with a CGI environment or other footage in post-production using software such as Adobe After Effects or Nuke. This technique is commonly used for creating special effects, such as when a character is supposed to be in a different location or inserting an animated character.  Studios like Arc Studios used this technique to create compelling VFX.\nOn the other hand, virtual production is a more recent & advanced technique that involves using real-time CGI to create the environment in which the actors perform. This is achieved through a virtual production stage, which includes advanced motion capture technology, real-time rendering, and other tools to create a fully immersive virtual environment.\nThe actors in virtual production can see the environment they are performing in through the use of monitors or VR headsets, & the virtual camera can capture the action in real-time. This technique is increasingly used in film and television production, allowing for greater flexibility and creative control.\nVirtual production has been used in several recent blockbuster films, including The Mandalorian, Avatar, and The Lion King. In these productions, the virtual production stage allowed filmmakers to create complex and realistic environments that would have been difficult or impossible to achieve using traditional filming methods.\nWhile green screen and virtual production share some similarities, they are distinct techniques with different applications and technology. Green screen is a post-production technique that involves replacing the background of a shot with a CGI environment or other footage. At the same time, virtual production is a real-time technique that creates a fully immersive virtual environment for the actors to perform in.\n\nThis content is brought to you by Akshay Shil\nPhoto provided by the author.\nDont like ads?

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nFreediving has been used for over 8,000 years as a means to explore and retrieve objects from the depths. Before the invention of the breathing apparatus, people would hold their breath for as long as possible. But do people still freedive today, and why do they do it?\nWhat is freediving?\nFreediving involves diving underwater while holding your breath without using atmospheric pressure or a gas supply. Its also known as skin diving, breath-hold diving, or apnea. Anyone who holds their breath while swimming underwater can be described as a freediver.\nHow did freediving begin?\nHumans have used freediving since 6,000 BC as a means to gather food, such as fish, and resources, such as pearls and sponges, to trade with. Divers were often hired to salvage valuable goods from the seabed after ships were wrecked in bad storms. During warfare, divers relayed messages or supplies to isolated troops, or they were sent ahead to take harbor barricades apart so that their ships could reach their enemy.\nHow has the equipment changed over time?\nFor a long time, freediving equipment was very crude, with the occasional use of reeds to assist breathing, rocks to get to depth, and ropes to ascend back to the surface quickly. However, at the beginning of the 20th century, freediving started to be seen as a recreational activity as people found ways to overcome the problems of cold, pressure, and limited vision.\nIn 1927 a mask was invented that covered the nose, and in 1938, an improved design that pinched the nostrils closed made it easier for divers to equalize when descending. The first fins or swimming propellers were patented in 1933, and in 1940 rubber suits were designed by a female freediving teacher. Neoprene wetsuits became available in 1951, and by the 70s, freediving for competition and scientific experimentation had become hugely popular.\nThese days there is an abundance of cutting-edge equipment, from lightweight silicone masks to water-resistant watches to depths of 300m. Freedivers can get everything they need to support their ocean adventure at\nAgulhasocean\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nWhat freediving activities are there?\nPeople take part in many activities involving freediving, from spearfishing to underwater rugby. As long as you can swim, there are few restrictions on what you can do.\nCompetitive apnea\nThere are different types of competitive apnea where freedivers compete individually to achieve the best score or to set a world record. Teams can also combine scores in international championships.\nSpearfishing\nSpearfishing traditionally involved the use of sharp sticks to strike fish. Nowadays, pneumatic or elastic-powered spearguns are favored. Care needs to be taken, though, not to hunt in areas where spearfishing is banned or restricted. For instance, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) has\ncontrol zones\nwhere it is prohibited to spearfish to ensure sustainable resources are maintained.\nFor those who prefer not to harm any fish, there is underwater target shooting where a speargun is aimed at targets instead. This sport can be played on an individual or team basis.\nUnderwater ball games\nFootball, rugby, and hockey can all be played underwater with the use of a negatively buoyant ball, torpedo, or puck. Weighted buckets are often used as goals.\nUnderwater wrestling\nOriginating in the former USSR, underwater wrestling or aquathlon takes place in a ring inside a swimming pool. Similar to ordinary wrestling, two combatants go several rounds attempting to remove the others ankle ribbon.\nThe takeaway\nFreediving is an ancient activity that is still popular today, whether its for food, exploration, pleasure, or sport. There are many clubs that offer courses and organize events and plenty of modern equipment to help you to go beyond the ordinary depths.\n",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\nAditya Ganjoo\nIt was the second lecture of the day.  so what is cos2x? asked the professor, engrossed in a problem, addressing the whole class. Trigonometry the old acquaintance has not been in touch with most of the students of this MBA batch. Obviously, they have dealt with a lot more in the last few years, and have forgotten about its existence. But not our friend. The Mr. Nice Guy. He lives by it. Calculus and trigonometry have been his meditation since the time he remembers carrying a personal cell phone.\nHis job as the design engineer required him to use trigonometry every day. But he did not even attempt to answer. Not that he did not want to!  anyone? asked the professor. Nice Guy missed a breath! A wave of shiver moved from his chest through his body, his hands trembled and then his feet. Although he looked normal, he could feel his heart thumping hard. It was his moment to shine a moment to acknowledge his love for the art. But in this condition, how could he speak? Sir it is cos square x minus sin square x someone yelled from the back. Nice Guys heart slowed down and his breath relaxed. He felt relieved. But then, a feeling of guilt filled him. Why do I mess this up every time!\nBefore we go ahead, let me introduce you to Mr. Nice Guy. He is basically a sweet and charming man, who genuinely wants to be of help to others. He maintains good relation with people, avoids conflict and does not want to be a moments trouble. And that is the problem.\nWhen he was a child, he was told that he was not important. Not directly, maybe. But he was told. When he had cried, his mother, who was too exhausted, ignored. He was slapped by his father when he asked his uncle for money  father wanted his kid to learn to not ask uncles for money. His teacher in school had punished him for laughing in class, while the girl who was laughing at him, was spared.\nBack then the kid Nice Guy was developing a paradigm about the world. With no knowledge about the laws of the universe, he was learning about gravity by falling on the tough concrete. And falling again, and again, and again. The kid Nice Guy was then taught by his grandmother the value of sacrificing oneself for the others. And just after the lesson, his elder brother ridiculed him, as he could not even open the door! . The kid had learnt that he was not that big of a deal!\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nThe kid Nice Guy grew up and became an adolescent Nice Guy. And, at every step, he looked at the world with the lens he had developed as a kid  his paradigm. Dirty lens showed ugly pictures.\nI could not hit the ball right! See they are laughing. Must be at me! Who else is the joker here! I couldnt score well in maths! Not surprising. I have never been good at anything She didnt talk to me. See! Girls dont talk to you unless you are a hunk!\nThe reinforced paradigm was now unbreakable. And he became an adult  a man.\nThe sweet charming man. He wants to see everyone happy. He agrees on everything you say. You may have realised that he is afraid. He is afraid to rock the boat! Any boat! He is afraid to order his favourite pao bhaji in a reunion with friends, as he might be called a kid for such a choice. He is afraid to tell his neighbour to move the car away from his gate, as he is expecting someone. While shopping, he has no opinion about what jacket should he purchase, because, deep down, he believes, he will look ugly in everything.\nBack into the classroom. What did just happen? Nice Guy had just survived. That simple question by a professor seemed like a near-death experience. A complicated, and probably foolish, conversation happened in his head:\nHey! I know the answer! I must speak\nShut up! Are you stupid?\nWhy! This is something I am more than confident! I must speak!\nNo! They would laugh! What if you stammered!\nI wont stammer! I know this answer very well!\nReally! Then why did you stammer last month in the train? Cant you recall those two aunties with smirks?\n\nAnd, what had happened when you could not pronounce that stupid word in class II?\nthey laughed!\n but Ill handle it! I have grown up! And no one will laugh\nEven if they dont will you be able to handle the attention?\n I might\nHave you ever seen how you look! Thats disgusting! Your one answer, and everyone will look at you! Id not want to be them!\n\n. And what if the professor asks a follow up question! Are you sure youd know the answer!\n.\nsee Ramesh answered! He saved you. Woooh! That was close! Next time take care of it! Stay shut! You are disgusting! Dont try to be what you are not. Keep yourself low!\nSounds familiar? Probably, you have heard this before! Maybe from a friend. Maybe from you just know it!\nDo you know a Nice Guy? He looks just like you. He smiles, he talks, just like you do. He is good at making himself your own reflection, as you wont criticise your lookalike  he is afraid of criticism. You might not find him easily, as even he doesnt know who he is. But someday, probably in a closed room, with a bottle of whiskey and some friends, when things are smooth, hed tell you and himself, subtly, who he is. And then, you may feel, that there are many Nice Guys around you  all in different degrees of niceness, all in different stages of healing, none happy with himself!\nWhat worse could have happened had the Nice Guy spoken in the class? He has designed essential boiler parts  probably the reason why the classroom he sat in was lit. That did not blow up! If he could handle not blowing up the national grid, could he not handle the consequences  whatever that may be  of speaking up? What worse could have happened if he had talked to that girl before moving out of the gate of his graduate college, to never come back. A few years back, he was asked to stand up from a general seat in the bus, so that a lady could sit. He was tired. What worse could have happened, had he flatly refused.\nOur Nice Guy volunteered to carry so much in his heart. He didnt know that he needed not to! Maybe, next time, when his friend asks what he wants to eat, he looks in her eyes and clearly says pao bhaji. Next time, when the professor asks about that cos2x, and his heart thumps hard in his chest, he still goes ahead and speaks up! And speaks up loud and clear! It takes a lot to kill a man! And his thumping heart is definitely not a lot. Maybe, the next time, he does everything he wants, being fully aware that he can handle the consequences! Maybe, with many such next times, he corrects his lenses  his paradigm  and believes that he is important.\n\n\nI met Aditya Ganjoo for the first time last Saturday morning at a Full House meeting.

      "body": "Leave a Comment\nAll through my life, I felt I would continuously get better at doing things. With practice, Id improve in sports, or writing, carpentry, cooking whatever I set my mind and body to do. Maybe most of us feel this way. Practice improves performance. But this is no longer true for me, at least not with physical skills and activities.\nI had in the past assumed that if I had a pain, it was temporary. And if I treated it kindly, wisely, and went to consult a doctor or some form of healer, it would eventually go away. No longer. Pains appear and do not always go away. They change all the time, but do not disappear forever.\nAnd meanwhile, time, life can go by too fast. Aging is changing.\nThe older we get, the faster our days, weeks, lives seem to disappear behind us; or the speed at which our life passes is directly proportional to our age. This seems to be a syndrome that plagues all (or most?) of us as we age. Maybe we should call it the aging time syndrome.\nI first heard about it in a college philosophy class. The professor said it was often used as an argument against the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent creator. How could a beneficent God allow time to speed up for us as we got closer to death?\nWhy it happens\nis not understood. Is it caused by a slowing down in our ability to process information so we cant keep up with time passing? Or is it because aging means we have more memories of old moments to shorten our habitation of the new? I dont know.\nBut the more I think about it, the more it becomes clear that what happens is not that the present goes by faster. We still have moments that can seem to last forever. What happens, I think, is that as we age, the past gets larger quicker. We look back and suddenly feel the day, the week, the decade they were here one moment, and too quickly, theyre gone.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nIs this sense of the past getting larger quicker an inherited alarm clock? An inborn prompt that evolved to teach us to live the last years or moments we have left more fully?\nLast night, I discovered new twists in an old exercise. At 3:30 am, after pain woke me up and I had trouble getting back to sleep, I decided to return to window watching, a practice I had begun earlier this year. But I changed it a bit and discovered new applications for it.\nInstead of gazing out the window to simply notice the beauty of the world, I took a breath and then looked to see what before I might have missed. I asked the night what beauty is here that in recent times had eluded me? What had I never verbalized to myself or others, or never felt? Or: what can I perceive now because of what I had noticed before? I looked outside; then closed my eyes and visualized the scene in my mind. Then l opened my eyes and looked again.\nThis was similar to an art exercise taught years ago by psychologist Lawrence LeShan, and another by Zen teacher Meido Moore.\nSo, when I did the night-watching practice, even outside my rural home no stars were visible. Black holes the shape of trees, buildings, and hillsides stood silhouetted against a gray sky a massive gray cloud filled by moonlight, yet with no moon visible. And the darkness appeared to begin in close to myself and lessen as it spread out into the distance.\nThis viewing brought me out of the pain and worry. The more focused on the outline of the trees, buildings, and hillsides, the more my mind stopped racing ahead, to fill itself with worries, plans, or regrets  with a time other than this, a place other than here, an imagined me other than everything. The more mind stopped racing, the more the\nsky became clear\n; the more the world came alive, and my life stopped disappearing into night.\nWe know everything is always changing. The Greek philosopher, Heraclitus, said we can never step in the same river twice. But its not just the river but ourselves that are always different. When were not so lost in thoughts, we can feel this, feel how were always changing, but changing along with everything else; one universe, together.\nWe cant stop change; but we can stop racing away from being present with it. If we stopped racing, we might stop dreading and expending energy fighting it, fighting ourselves, and aging ourselves more quickly.\nSo, focusing on the world outside my window with the intent to simply observe; to notice the beauty, notice the changes, changed my pain, and worry, and my response to both. They became small details in a vast world outlined by clouds of moonlight.\nAnd the feeling that we can get, especially as we become older, of the world racing ahead; that our lives, time, were going too fast that stops, for a moment. Or at least it slows, as also happens in meditation, nature walks and such, creating art, joyful encounters. And we can go back to bed and rest as the whole universe resting.\n",

But two months into these workouts, Im getting more comfortable, and I know what to expect, so Ive begun telling him more about my life in those rests between reps: that my left shoulder was damaged in the first set of Covid vaccines, that when I go for a walk, I call it a hike. That Im trying to get comfortable saying no.\nI read a book that recommends saying no in the mirror while looking into my own eyes, I report. Apparently, that should not make one squeamish. The gym has two full walls of mirrorsI try never to look at myself.\nCool, he says, moving us to the first piece of equipment. Ok, lets try something new. Come over here, take this cable, and pull down. He demonstrates. Weight on your heels.\nNo, I say politely, but I hold very still and keep my eyes on the floor. He releases the extension on the cable pull laughing, then extends it to me, again. Very funny, here you go.\nNo, I repeat, looking up with a smile. Ive just noticed I feel different oddly good. Im sorry, I continue, that doesnt work for me. No. Ive just flexed a new muscle and Im inspired to practice, but we are both laughing now, and that happens a lot. These intimate exchanges between strangers when humor disarms, and laughter connects in a surge of goodwill. (You know thats what Im doing with you, right?)\nNow Im lying on a padded bench lifting a set of free weights while JT stands over me to keep me from breaking my own heart when I tire and collapse the weights to my chest. I think of something funny, lose concentration in a way no one could possibly see, yet he says, What? You just left. Whered you go?  Theres no doubt that the seat of humor is in the right brain hemisphere where intuition resides, where we seek patterns and understand metaphor.\nFor now, the endorphins are kicking in and Im getting stupid-silly. Look, Im stylin! I say, placing my dangling dead arm, the one not being used, jauntily on my hip, then over my head in a ballerinas extension.\nBut I dont laugh when Im really struggling. (I say tortured, JT says challenged.) Potato/ Potaetoe. My arms tremble and I know Ive reached the limit of my endurance.\nI cant, I just cant, I pant, warning JT that he better be ready to catch me, Im going to have to let go.\nOh, shut up, he says. Just shut up with I cant.\nNice, I say. I tell you no, you tell me to shut up, and weve got playground equipment. Im four, and youre what, six?\nBut I know why he says this. The brain believes what you tell it. (Did you know that we are affected by false flattery\neven when we know it is false\n?) And rather than contradict a negative statement Im unworthy, unforgivenoh, and I cant lift 12-pound free weights, your brain will look for evidence that those things are true\nbecause you said they were\n. So, tell only your best and brightest stories about yourself and about everyone because they are more than words, they are energy.\nJTs always watching without watchingto see how far he can push the limits to get the last drop of gas out of the tank and hes got the deft sleight of hand of a card dealer or magician. Hell swap out weights in the middle of a routine for heavier ones and deny it, but because I believe I can lift what Ive been given, I can.\nOkay, get down on your elbows in a plank and do this, JT says, now demonstrating yet another maneuver that no actual human being would do.  Do it yourself, I say just to mess with him, but I do as Im told. Supervision is nice. Not being in charge is a relief.\nMaybe we laugh so much because straining against resistance, having someone to catch you when you have to let go, doesnt just make you stronger, it lifts burdens you didnt know you were carrying, frees your heart. Makes room for the new.\nIf there is a God, and in my experience, there is, hes definitely at the gym. In this environment of communing, of partnership, you are worthy, you are forgiven. You can lift 12-pound free weights. You can say no to what doesnt serve you and yes to what does.\nYou did good today, JT says as I get ready to leave. He takes a swig from a water bottle on his desk and squints at me appraisingly in the afternoon light. Do you know that because youre my last client on Friday the weekend always starts off with something fun?\nIts a casual remark whether or not it is true. Even if its false flattery, Im affected by it. Im ridiculous. I love the idea of making someone else happy just being myself, without giving something away in exchange. Yet every molecule in my being wants to deflect the intimacy of being liked, (\nreally? still?),\nwants to make a joke, then walk out the door. But here at the gym, I can do whatever I believe I can. So, I smile in the mirror and say, Yes.\nLaura J. Oliver is an award-winning developmental book editor and writing coach, who has taught writing at the University of Maryland and St. Johns College.

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nYou heard me right. Fellas, you cant win with women. You never will. There is no silver bullet. No One sentence will get her to like you. No one text you can send will get her to change her mind. I really wished there had been a silver bullet back in the day. I have a financial hole in my pocket to prove how much I searched for that one line.\nTheres nothing.\nSo thats it!? Theres nothing you can do?\nYes, there is absolutely nothing you can do to attract every single woman you possibly meet, and Ill explain why.\nMy Dating Journey\nFrom 20142020 I learned and studied dating, pick-up techniques, chatting up women, relationships, romance, what women like in men, and all the rest. I listened to female dating coaches and male dating coaches. I purchased 52 books and watched hundreds of hours of content on youtube.\nWhy? Well, Ive always loved pursuing great women and enjoyed the company of a special woman. At that moment in my life, I realized I was ready to find THE woman for me. So I wasnt going to take the task lightly.\nI loved it! Im an extrovert, so I applied everything I learned and sucked it in immediately. Did it all.\nNow I want to be clear; I wasnt doing this to be a player or a fuck boi. I was doing it because I wanted the woman of my dreams. I had clairvoyance enough to know I wasnt going to get the perfect woman cause they dont exist. But I knew I could get my version of perfect.\nI knew it.\nI also had two sources of dating  online dating and meeting women in real life. On the weekend, I would be out with my friends, whether at the bars, clubs, social events, parties, mixers, or anything with the opposite sex who were single; Id always be in the market to find someone.\nI dont care what anyone says. It was such a good learning experience. I developed an abundance of social skills that have helped me to this day!\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nBecause I used both online dating apps and meeting people in real life, I learned the true difference between meeting women in real life and meeting women I approached online. Cause lets face it, fellas. Women rarely approach men, and if they do, its typically the women we dont want (Sorry). So whats the difference?\nMeeting Women In Real Life\nPros\nYou harness better social queues: much quicker as you have to be quick, or youll get buried out there in those social settings; remember, the best-looking women have been approached far more then youve ever approached them.\nAuthentic connection: Meeting women in real life allows for genuine interaction and the ability to read body language, which is key for building trust and rapport. Studies have shown that nonverbal cues play a significant role in communication, with up to 93% of communication being nonverbal. Yes, its that serious.\nImmediate feedback: In-person interactions provide real-time feedback, allowing you to adjust your approach and improve communication skills, trust me the feedback is good or bad. You gotta have tough skin. Ive straight up had women tell me to f**K off. Ive literally just said, hello,.\nReduced competition: Compared to online dating, where women can be bombarded with messages and options, meeting women in real life means you are not competing against numerous other dudes, and having the confidence to approach her increases your chances of standing out.\nYou learn what some women like to hear: and certain things most women dont want to hear. This makes your failures and embarrassments your greatest tool for confidence and future vocal engagements.\nYoure unique: What makes you different is doing the complete opposite of what most men do, and you learn that after failed attempts and seeing other men act stupid. Experience will always be the greatest teacher.\nReal face-to-face interaction: with women you think you are attracted to gives you a good taste of who you might connect with online.\nShared interests: Meeting women through activities or social groups increases the likelihood of shared interests and hobbies, which has been proven to be an essential factor in long-lasting relationships.I love writing and met a lot of women through writing groups via Meet-Up.\nGalvanized confidence: Approaching and talking to women in real life helps build confidence, social skills, and assertiveness, but doing it consistently means your confidence is often at a peak state.\nEnhanced attractiveness: A study published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships found that physical attractiveness is more accurately assessed in person than in photos, giving you a better chance of making a good impression. So you could go from a 5 online to a 7 in real life.\nSerendipity factor: Meeting women in real life adds an element of spontaneity and serendipity that can create memorable experiences and unique stories that can strengthen a budding relationship. Im unsure, but I might have heard some women LOVE this.\nChemistry assessment: Physical chemistry is more easily evaluated in person, allowing both parties to determine if theres potential for a romantic connection.\n\n\nCons\nIts a crap shoot. : Approaching a woman you find attractive is the biggest shot in the dark. Boundaries matter, and you must approach them with caution and respect.\nLooks do matter: so even if youre conventionally attractive, certain women have the luxury of having a niche type within a type within a type, and unless you fit that, youre rejected.\nRejection sensitivity: Meeting women in real life can result in facing heavy rejection directly. As I said, they will not hold back, and a lot of people will often applaud them for verbally castrating you if you have rejection sensitivity, this will bury you. Studies have shown that rejection sensitivity is linked to lower self-esteem and increased anxiety.\nLimited options: In-person interactions may offer fewer potential partners compared to online dating platforms, which can provide a wider range of choices and increase the likelihood of finding a compatible match. Dating in Paris, Ohio, is different than dating in Brooklyn, NYC.\nTime investment: Meeting women in real life can be a time suck. This is why I mixed my social time with opportunities to meet new people.\nYour best approach: outfit, look, engagement, humor, and all the rest wont change shit. Attraction cant be forced.\nEven if youre nothing but a gentleman: it wont stop a woman from being horrible, rude, and blunt with you. Sometimes some women project other douchebags bad behavior on you.\nSocial anxiety: For those with social anxiety, approaching and interacting with women in real life can be intimidating and challenging.\nMissed opportunities: In real-life settings, it can be challenging to identify if someone is single or interested in dating. This can result in missed opportunities for connection due to the ambiguity of social cues. I have definitely tried to chat it up with women unbeknownst to me who have boyfriends; they were just f",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\nWhen the modern mind attempts to grapple with animistic concepts like the sun is alive, the first impulse is to dismiss them as a superstitious fancy. Thankfully, many of us recognize the culturally imperialistic tone of that dismissal. We may also be in touch with our own fundamental indigenous knowledge, however deeply buried it may be under layers of scientific education, that the sun is indeed alive. We want somehow to accept that without denying what science has taught us: that the sun is a burning ball of gas, a nuclear furnace, and couldnt possibly be alive.\nOne way to accommodate both is to make aliveness into an extra-material property, a spirit that infuses all things. The sun is alive because everything is alive. But to do so is to subtly capitulate to the worldview that holds everything dead, by making aliveness an added property, independent of anything material. It is a version of Cartesian dualism.\nHere I will offer another, much more radical alternative. It is an exhilarating alternative. It is a homecoming. It may guide human relations with life generally.\nWhen I say the sun is alive, I dont mean that in the animist sense that everything is alive. If everything is alive, the word alive loses its meaning. We might seek to animate rocks by calling them alive, putting them in the same category as humans, ants, and trees, but we risk by the same token reducing humans, ants, and trees to the status of rocks, comporting with the Newtonian reduction of life to force and mass.\nNo, I mean the sun is actually alive. Thats why I usually refer to it as Mister Sun. Just kidding. Anthropomorphizing non-human beings is just as much a denial of their beingness as to deny it outright.\nI used to think that the sun was only a nuclear furnace, burning up hydrogen by fusing hydrogen nuclei together into other elements (primarily helium) and releasing photons in the process. A furnace is not alive. It doesnt maintain homeostasis. It doesnt respond in complex ways to stimuli. It doesnt evolve over time. It doesnt have organs or other complex structures. It doesnt have a complex metabolism.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nIn the conventional account of stellar physics, main-sequence stars like the sun are stable because the gas pressure of their plasma equals the inward gravitational pressure generated by their mass. This balance depends on the relative strengths of the various forces of physics. For example, the weak nuclear force launches the proton-proton chain reaction that converts colliding proton pairs into stable deuterium nuclei. If the electromagnetic force were just a bit stronger relative to the strong force, these diprotons would never form. If the weak force were a little stronger, runaway fusion would blow the sun apart in seconds.\n1\nIf it were weaker, the sun would not ignite in the first place.\nMarvelous though it is that the forces of physics are exquisitely calibrated to allow life, there may be something else going on in solar fusion. The sun is extraordinarily complex, with mutually sustaining material and electromagnetic structures. Millions of convection cells, called granulatons, convey plasma to and from deep in the suns interior. These vast fluxes of plasma generate magnetic fields, which, in complex nonlinear feedback loops, in turn shape the flow of plasma. These interactions influence, and are influenced by, the huge magnetic field generated by the different rotational speed of the suns core and outer layers.\nThe complex, dynamic structures of the sun allow matter and energy to move between layers, so that the sun could conceivably adjust the composition of its core to slow or speed the rate of fusion. Not only could this allow it to maintain homeostasis, but also may enable the sun to respond to various stimuli.\nWatching this NASA video displaying a computer model of the suns magnetic field lines, the idea that the sun is alive doesnt seem so far-fetched.\nSome scientists even broach the possibility that stars like the sun are not only alive, but also conscious volitional agents. Rupert Sheldrake gives a good overview of the arguments in his 2021 paper,\nIs the Sun Conscious?\nAccording to Sheldrake, the complexity of the suns electromagnetic structures rival or exceed those of the human brain, a fact of special significance in light of the growing recognition of the role of electromagnetic fields in memory, cognition, and consciousness.\nOne characteristic of life is volitional movement. Bacteria, animals, fungi, and even plants move in response to their environment, for instance toward food and away from danger. Stars like the sun may do so as well, perhaps through solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Conventional scientific opinion holds the occurrence of such events to be random. But what if they are a means of intentional locomotion, as an octopuss ink jet? According to the physicist Greg Matloff, this provides a possible explanation for various anomalies in stellar motion, the most significant of which is the cohesion of galaxies. Their stars rotate around the galactic core too quickly to be held there by the gravitation of observable matter. In order to preserve the accepted Law of Gravitation, physicists postulate invisible dark matter to explain the motions of stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters.\nThat makes sense if stars are dead masses subject to gravitation alone. When we observe a flock of birds, we dont assume there must be dark matter holding the flock together by gravitation, because we recognize the birds as volitional agents. Maybe stars are like birds in a flock (or neurons in a brain), sticking together for some purpose we cannot fathom. Matloff and philosopher Clement Vidal claim that stellar locomotion is a testable hypothesis: just observe whether stellar flares are more common or more energetic in the opposite direction of their revolution around the galactic core.\nThis hypothesis leaves out another important influence: the dynamic, meta-stable electromagnetic structure of galaxies themselves. Once we admit the possibility of living stars, we naturally consider a living galaxy as well. Indeed, at the galactic scale and beyond, vast plasma structures weave the cosmos together, pulling stars and galaxies into their observed configurations. At least that is what an unorthodox lineage of physicists, most notably the Nobel laureate Hannes Alfvn, claim. They theorize that electromagnetism is a primary structuring force of the universe, or even the primary structuring force. Plasma cosmologists use electromagnetism to explain the observed motions of stars and galaxies without recourse to dark matter. Some go further to offer alternative theories of cosmogenesis, stellar and galaxy formation, solar physics, and gravity itself.\nWhile many of these theories are decidedly fringe, the work of Alfvn and his proteges is generally consistent with standard physics, requiring no dramatic revision of its f",

If I asked 100 adults what they think it is, I bet Id get a lot of different answers. Our ability to speak, to communicate, someone might say. Thinking! Without thinking, civilization would never developed, another might suggest. The ability to create! To make things. And so on. What do you think?\nActually, you learned your most important skill before you could do any of these arguably significant things. It was around the time you were one year old. Before you could think consciously, speak your mind, or create anything with your hands, you learned something much easier yet also more fundamental: putting one foot in front of the other. You learned how to walk.\nIn more than one way, thats what youve been doing ever since. Not always with your feet, of course.

Its the only way to move through life, but its also the best thing we do.\nWhen life is tough, things arent going well, and you dont want to get out of bed, keep walking.

      "body": "Leave a Comment\nDont you love the cloud of steam that rises when you first break through the crust on a hot chicken pot pie? There is that soft hiss as the puff pastry resting lightly on the pie pan falls apart, or when the fragile buttery sheet of top crust is shattered. It is a warm and reassuring. Baking nurtures. Baking satisfies. We developed some survivalist baking skills during COVID, remember all that sour dough bread? This is the good creative stuff, that we can enjoy and share.\nWe are enjoying a respite between holidays and birthdays at the moment. Sometimes holiday baking feels like factory work, rolling out dozens of sheets of uniform, decorated cookies for Christmas. Now, in mid-April, when there isnt any pressure, it is a pleasure to bake a batch of chocolate chip cookies on a Sunday afternoon. No one expects fresh, homemade baked cookies when kitchen gets too hot. This is shoulder season, between the cold of winter and the heat of summer. It is the time to pounce, and enjoy baking. Summer is lurking just around the corner.\nThe weather has been peculiar, as we all have noticed. I felt like the daffodils were up awfully early this year, because we had such a mild winter. But I went through photographs for the past few years, and saw that the daffodils have been keeping to a strict schedule. I was all ready for summer to descend on us last week, and then chilly winter rains roared back. Now is the time to enjoy some low pressure, recreational baking, before I start whining about how hot it is, and how I cant bear to be in the kitchen.\nShoulder season is the perfect time to bake: low stakes, low pressure. Easter is behind us. Thanksgiving is months away. Lets start with some chicken pot pie. Something warm and cosy for dinner.\nhttps://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/chicken-pot-pie.html\nThere is no better time to practice working out pie crusts  when the weather is still cool, and there is no holiday meal panic. You dont need to strive for perfection when you are baking in April, learning how to mix flour and butter with your fingers. You are building muscle memory. But if the siren song of the garden is too strong, some Pepperidge Farm puff pastry is a mighty fine cooks tool, too. You will still get the gentle whoosh of steam in your face when cutting open a pie topped with store-bought crust. We embrace time-saving technology and innovations here in the Spy Test Kitchens.\nDorie Greenspan has lots of practical hints for pie crusts for fruit pies. Arent you longing for something sweet? Strawberries are coming into season, and they are always better with rhubarb. And we wont be waiting too much longer for blueberries. You can extend shoulder season by baking fruit pies at night, when the kitchen will cool off while you catch up on Ted Lasso.\nhttps://doriegreenspan.com/recipe/blueberry-pie-a-lesson-in-piemaking/\nFocaccia is simple and forgiving. There are no techniques you need to master, no fancy equipment. You just need flour, yeast , olive oil, salt and a little time. (This is a gifted recipe from the New York Times that everyone can read here.\nYou have to remember that it takes two days. You cannot read this piece and expect to turn around and bake a pan of it for tonights dinner. It takes two days of resting time, and two days of space in the fridge. I baked a pan last week, and we still have three more servings of focaccia in the freezer. We tore through the first quarter with sausage and peppers. Tonight we will have the second quarter when we have Marthas famous One Pan Pasta, because the container garden has started to yield lots of fragrant basil and it is definitely feeling like spring outside.\nhttps://food52.com/recipes/30147-martha-stewart-s-one-pan-pasta\nThis is our favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. It is practically health food because it also has oatmeal as one of the main ingredients. It takes longer to assemble all of the ingredients from the pantry and the cabinets than it does to mix the cookie dough, so be sure to line them all up on the kitchen counter. It is another handy dandy recipe to mix up, and then only bake about a dozen cookies. I shape the rest of the dough into little balls, then periodically break out frozen balls of cookie dough to bake (at 375F for 10 minutes) when we need a little treat. (And I hate to disappoint Dorie, but I use chocolate chips, I do not chop chocolate. Mr. Sanders has certain chocolate expectations and I dont like to disappoint.)\nhttps://food52.com/recipes/78188-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies\nSlow down. Enjoy the spring sunshine, and relish wearing a light sweater at night. Start looking for fireflies, and listen for the peepers. A little baking is good for your creative soul if you can take your time.\nThe place I like best in this world is the kitchen. No matter where it is, no matter what kind, if its a kitchen, if its a place where they make food, its fine with me. Ideally it should be well broken in. Lots of tea towels, dry and immaculate.\n Banana Yoshimoto",

      "description": "Can artificial intelligence replicate human consciousness?",
      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nThere is a recent article, Can artificial intelligence replicate human consciousness?, where a professor was quoted, saying, [Chatbots] appear to be thinking and doing things on their own  they are not because they actually dont have life in themselves. They dont have a possibility of mind, they dont have a possibility of consciousness in the sense that we do.\nYes, they do not have consciousness in the sense of humans, however, consciousness as what? A factor of mind, or life? What is the definition of consciousness for a human in a coma, vegetative state or under general anesthesia? The human may not feel, know things or have an emotion [so to speak] in those states, but an artificial or computerized intelligence can at least know the weather or give definitions.\nSo, while life is present, the mind is not at its normal state and there is an alternate consciousness. How is it possible to define consciousness to encompass all states? There is often the description of consciousness with subjective experience, or the question of why have subjective experiences if it is possible to do things without it?\nConsciousness can be defined as the rate at which any system can know, with a maximum value of 1. Knowing is the overall of consciousness. Subjective experience or the I in anything has to be known. There are stages of sleep, where people move, talk or take other actions, without the I. The mind powers it and knows, but the degree is not let on to the subjective property.\nSubjective experience is a property on the mind that can be acquired by a quantity, to a degree that makes it known. The reason for the subjective feeling or the I in anything is towards attachment, possession or owning of the experience, against detachment or externalizing of what could be useful, say for survival, community building or rearing of offspring.\nDont like ads?

One of them also has prioritization at any moment with a higher number than others, which can even get higher in an extreme situation.\nEvery division of consciousness [knowing or sentience] contributes to the total, or 1. Humans are the standard for consciousness. Animals also have parts of these making them conscious. Plants have aspects of some too.\nLarge language models or artificial intelligence have a very high M, or without the F, t or E. The M they have is sometimes higher than the possible minimum for humans in that area, giving them a low level of consciousness or sentience.\nAn object like an automobile, for example, can know, or has separate parts that do their tasks, but they can all be referred to as negligibly conscious, since their M does not get to the human minimum and their knowing is regimented. If it crashes, there are actions it may take, but it does not have the E or F, to feel hurt or be sad.\nIt may be possible to build some E or F into a sensor for a vehicle, to understand what it means when things go wrong, but it will not be a direct pain, but of non-I knowing.\nPain is a property on the human mind that is experienced when it is acquired by a quantity within the mind, sometimes by incoming signals or local.\nThe property acquires an early part of that pain, within the property of the organ in the mind, before going to the main pain property, to achieve an appropriate degree. The property may also move to the principal spot.\nIt is this conceptual mechanism for pain across mind location that also determines referred pain and phantom pain.\n",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nYou never expected it to happen; in fact, you were pretty sure it wouldnt. Falling in love wasnt part of the plan, especially not with this person. You were supposed to be just friends, sharing laughs and good times, but fate had other plans.\nIn the beginning, everything seemed perfect. You laughed together, shared stories, and grew closer with each passing day. But then, it happened. The unthinkable: you fell for them. Hard. You berated yourself, thinking, Why did I have to be so stupid? But your heart refused to listen to logic. It wanted what it wanted, and you couldnt help but feel a magnetic pull toward them.\nYou may discover that at this point, you are wishing that you had never even spoken to them. If only you could go back to a time before your heart decided to betray you, to a time when you could simply enjoy their company without being overwhelmed by these intense feelings, you would do anything to do so. Yet, as the old proverb goes, you cant put the toothpaste back in the tube. After youve said how you feel, theres no turning back now.\nThe day they found out your secret was the day everything changed. Even though you didnt want them to find out, they did. Now, instead of getting closer, youre drifting apart, and your friendship is getting strained and uncomfortable. You cant help but wonder what could have happened if things had stayed the same, with just two friends having fun together without the complications of love.\nAs you learn to live in this new world, you have to face the hard truth that life doesnt always go as planned. Youre now acting like strangers and hardly recognize the person you used to call your best friend. Even though youre hurting and confused, theres a part of you that cant help but hold on to the hope that maybe, just maybe, something beautiful can still come out of this mess.\nEvery time you talk, you both feel like youre on the edge and dont know what to do next. And as you move forward in this uncertain dance, you cant help but wonder if the fall will lead to a deeper connection or the end of the relationship you once valued. You wonder if the feelings you have for each other are strong enough to get past the problems and close the growing gap between you.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nWhen things are quiet, you think about what you liked about them in the first place. Their kindness, the warmth of their laughter, and the way their eyes light up when they talk about something they are very passionate about. These memories give you a little bit of hope and help you remember why your heart chose this path.\nWhile you two explore the new region of your developing relationship, keep in mind that being vulnerable may often result in the deepest of bonds. Despite the anxiety and doubt, it may be worth it to express your emotions and be open to the potential of love.\nEven though you dont know what will happen in the future, one thing is clear: this journey has changed you both, and you cant go back to how things were before. The fall might hurt, but it also gives you the chance to grow and change. Its up to you to decide if you want to accept the change and see if it could lead to a closer, stronger relationship or let your fear of the unknown stop you.\nSo, as you stand on the edge of this emotional cliff, remember that you can change your future. Will you take a leap of faith and trust that love can take you to places you never thought possible, or will you stick with what you know and let the what ifs haunt you for the rest of your life?\nYou decide, and only time will show where this fall will lead.",

      "description": "My great humbling as a father.",
      "body": "Leave a Comment\nI had high hopes as a dad. Probably too high. No, let me amend thatthey were definitely too high.\nWhen my first son was placed in my arms, I cried so hard that the people in the next hospital room thought wed lost our baby. Thats how visceral it was for me. Holding flesh of my flesh in my arms felt primal, like Id just met my purpose.\nTwo sons later and I was still feeling it. Fifteen years later, still in the pocket.\nThen the pituitary gland started spewing hormones into their teenage veins; testosterone appeared, and suddenly, I was usurped by peers and other urges.\nAnd I didnt adjust well. I didnt. I failed to recalibrate, and I was thrown off my parenting game.\nAnd sure, I can blame the fact that as they entered adolescence, I was asked to serve as the pastor of our church and the whole preacher-kid thing became a thing. I can blame the pressure they felt when a hundred pairs of eyes were bearing down on them during their toughest growing-up years. And I can point a finger at their Sodom and Gomorrah school or the popularity that comes from being good at sports.\nBut no matter the outside influences, I didnt evolve into a good dad for my teens. In fact, I became the dad I never wanted to be. I became an authoritarian; I became the because I said so dad. I became a hardline dad when I should have become the listening and drawing out and nurturing dad.\nBut above allwhat I consider my greatest sinI stopped listening to my parental gut. The intuition that had guided me well for fifteen yearsthat internal voice of reason a dad has about his boysI started to silence it. Again, I can blame all the eyes of the church and the pressure I felt and the strong arm of my leaders, but still, it was me who listened to the galley and not my heart.\nThen, on a calm, sunny Sunday afternoon, it all blew up. While I was putting some clothes away in my bedroom closet, my testosterone-fueled, near-his-tipping-point sixteen-year-old son came in and asked if he could go to a school dance. Just a dance. The Winter Formal, to be exact.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nI didnt want him to go. It was a place where alcohol and hormones ran amok. And events like this had not been a part of our family up to that point. But over the previous year, things had changed. My eldest had chosen his own way and, for the most part, I had supported him. But now there was pressure from my senior pastor and the other parents of teens to draw a hard line.\nDont let him go, they said, just say no.\nBut I knew it wasnt that easy. I knew the ground in my home was shifting. My intuition told me that if I didnt turn the release valve a bit, I might see an explosion.\nWell, I didnt listen to my gut. I said no to the dance. And now, twenty years later, I see that on that afternoon, my family turned. My son freaked out. He stormed out of my bedroom, slammed his bedroom door, and let out a Herculean scream that still gives me chills to this day. He exploded with frustration and anger and exasperation.\nAnd something I didnt know until recentlysomething that helped me understand why my family imploded as it didwas that his younger brother, fifteen years old, was in the room to witness that primal explosion. He saw the fury. He felt the radiation. He watched the recklessness enter his older brother that morphed into a battle with his parents. And at that moment, in that tiny bedroom, these two brothers decided that they would both light the world on fire. Gone was civility. Gone was playing the part of the pastors good sons. Now it was war.\nThis fusion radiated in our home for the next fifteen years. At first, they fell headlong into just alcohol and weed. But as they moved on from high school, it became opioids and then heroin and even meth for a time. Words like detox and rehab and felon entered our family lexicon.\nAt year fifteen, my middle sonthe one whod witnessed the primal screamafter a week-long heroin bender, killed a man with his car while high on heroin.\nThis is when I became a candidate for the fraternity of disappointed dads.\nA week after the accident, with my son locked down at LA County jail, after the charges had been headlined in our local paper, I felt a shift in my psyche. Suddenly, I was no longer just me. I was now the dad of that guy who killed that man. I felt like I had a scarlet letter on my chest.\nThe next day I went to my local gym and felt every bit the outcast. The check-in girl, after my name popped up on her screen, spun her head to look at me. Did she know I was that dad? Several people on exercise machines popped a glance at me. Do they know? I picked up my pace to the locker room and as I changed my clothes, overcome with emotional claustrophobia, I envisioned shouting to my imaginary critics, You dont know me! You dont know how hard Ive tried! I tried!. I did the best I could! I slammed the locker door shut, grabbed a towel, and beelined it to the weight room.\nThe problem is, Im not a weight room guy. Im a racket guy or a swimming guy or a yoga guy. Not a lifter of metal.\nBut that had all changed when I discovered that moving iron makes hormones flow and liquefies frustration and channels rage out of the pores. As I squatted, I thought, Screw that receptionist. Screw those people working out. And screw those families who hate us and judge us and talk about us in hushed tones, in darkened living rooms, pointing their long fingers in my familys direction.\nAfter a few sets, I went to drink at the water fountain, and four friends, who Id often played racquetball with, exited the court, and milled around. One looked in my direction and snickered. Are they mocking me? One wagged his head while looking down. Are they judging me? Another fish-eyed me and shook his head condescendingly. They think Im the worst dad ever!\nI rushed back over to my little corner of the weight room, frantic with paranoia, and I got careless. I heaved weights around; I lifted more than I should have; I jeopardized my injury-prone back. Who cares anymore? I dont give a damn. I wanted to hurl my weights against the wall; I wanted to smash the mirror with my barbell; I wanted to scream at all those self-centered, vain narcissists in that room; I wanted to grab my racquetball friends face and hold it two inches from mine, and scream at him until I went hoarse and then scream some more until his face melted in my hands; I wanted to curl into a ball and dissolve into the cement floor; I wanted to vanish, to have never been a father, or a husband, or to have ever been at all. I pushed and jerked and heaved and cried and sweated until I could barely stand.\nDont like ads?

For several seconds he looked up at me on my platform and then stepped forward, wrapped his arms around me, and hugged me tightly. I was amused at fi",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\nWe Americans are shooting each other so frequently that to keep track we categorize shootings by type, subtype, and number of people shot per incident. Was it a school, restaurant, church, workplace, or home shooting? Was the motivation hate, non-hate, or unknown? If hate, what type of hate, racial, religious, ideological, or domestic? If non-hate, was it insanity, suicide, drug-related or other? Was it a mass shooting (3 or more deaths) or not?\nIs this a problem? What is a problem? A problem is a situation that someone thinks something should be done about.\nI observe almost unanimity of agreement that we have a gun violence problem. The argument is what to do about it. The basic equation looks like this:\nGun plus shooter equals death.\nWhats the solution?\nSome say the problem is the relatively easy access to the most effective killing devices, either assault rifles or pistols with high-capacity magazines. Only military and law enforcement should have these weapons. Pass laws banning them from civilian use.\nOthers say no, its mentally-disturbed people, the shooters who are the problem. We already have enough laws regulating these weapons. We need to strengthen and better enforce those laws. And besides, the rulebook says its my right to have as many guns as I please.\nThe thing is, these two camps are equally divided, and we have designed our system such that if this is the case, nothing can be done. In other words, we find ourselves in a paradox, a catch-22 where we have designed the problem to be, at this juncture, insoluble. We are self-paralyzed.\nThe rulebook says it can be rewritten. But to do that we have to have a supermajority in agreement. We cant have a 50-50 split of opinions by Americans and our representatives in Congress. Bear in mind that lawmakers, no matter what ill we might think of them, are only doing what we want them to do (I am speaking collectively here, not what you and I individually desire).\nSo the answer lies in the collective will of the American people. Why arent we solving this problem? Three possibilities: Again speaking collectively, we are either insane, stupid, or dont care. I dont think we are insane or stupid, so it must be that we dont care. That is, we dont care\nenough\n. Gun violence is not a priority. We vote for our representatives based on issues we care more about than our kids being murdered in school.\nI have a couple of suggestions, but first let me say something about that tiresome fallback, the Second Amendment. It says:\nA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\nWhat was Madisons intent? I am not a mind reader but I do understand English grammar. The words say that citizens can possess arms so they can come together as militias in times when the security of their state or country is either threatened from within, say by a tyrannical federal government, or from without, by a foreign entity. The last phrase, then, is dependent on the first. But the first is ignored by those who claim the right to possess any number of weapons of any type for any reason or purpose. Note that the Second Amendment does not preclude a citizen from owning a nuclear weapon! Is that a good idea? If Madison had been sufficiently prescient, would he have approved of arms available to citizens today, or that we would use those arms to murder our own kids?\nThankfully, we have federal and state laws that restrict certain types of weapons citizens can own  machine guns, mortars, and tanks being examples. But even these can be owned if one has the money and patience to adhere to regulations required.\nLets talk solutions.\nThe best solution, as indicated above, is repeal and replacement of the Second Amendment. But considering todays political climate, thats not realistic.\nWhat about the shooter part of the equation? To me, this is the most difficult because it involves human psychology and mental well-being, the most complicated and unpredictable forces in the known universe. Trying to predict the next active shooter is virtually impossible. A person who seems perfectly normal today could succumb to depression (or worse) tomorrow. It happened to me, so I figure it could happen to anyone. Fortunately, my depression did not involve harming other than myself. We have more work to do on the shooter; Im not suggesting otherwise.\nNow to the gun. If youll forgive the trite business metaphor, the gun is low-hanging fruit. Its the easiest part of a complex problem to tackle. I dont buy the argument that because rapid-fire guns with high-capacity magazines are only one element of the mass-killing equation that we have already done enough to regulate their use. No, we havent done enough. We could require more-thorough background checks and longer waiting periods for purchase. We could ban new sales of assault-type rifles. We could make them more expensive by adding federal tax on top of state sales taxes. We could require annual re-registration, close gun show loopholes, and make unregistered private transfers illegal.\nWe could also call, email, or write our representatives to let them know how serious we are about solving this problem. For my neighbors in District 1, dont bother contacting Andy Harris. I tried that and found by his form-letter reply that he thinks Maryland already has sufficient gun laws on the books.\nTechnology to the rescue?\nHeres an idea I think could work for new gun sales. My car has an electronic door lock which functions only if my key is close the car. We could require all new guns capable of accepting high-capacity magazines to have electronic trigger locks such that if they are within the vicinity of a target-rich environment like a school, restaurant, place of worship, stadium, or any place where crowds gather, the gun cannot fire. RF signals (WIFI?) could communicate with the gun either from the protected location or by satellite using GPS data. Only law enforcement personnel would have weapons in which the electronic lock feature could be cancelled.\nOne more element: Yesterday the Tennessee legislature expelled two of its members for violating house decorum in protesting the recent school shooting in Nashville. Of the three protesters, two of which were black men, the other a white lady, only the black men were expelled. In a state with a long history of racial bigotry we should ask why.\nMaybe Im getting desperate. I dont know about you, but I think having our kids murdered in school is beyond intolerable. We cannot let this remain business-as-usual.\nBob Moores retired from Black & Decker/DeWalt in 1999 after 36 years. He was the Director of Cordless Product Development at the time.

      "body": "Leave a Comment\nThe myth about boys raised by single moms having a higher chance of turning delinquents is crumbling, as studies show. Still, the question remains: how much do boys need a father figure?\nI have been exploring masculinity for the past two years. (Ok, to be fair, Ive been exploring it much longer, but not systematically.) So far, I have interviewed close to seventy men and one of the recurring themes is the importance of the male role model for a boy to grow into a mature man. They say: Women give birth to boys. Men give birth to men.\nNever mind that I believe that girls are just as much influenced by the presence or absence of a male role model as boys are. The fact that girls need for men in their lives is rarelyor at least a lot lessdiscussed reveals the deeper fallacy of the discussion, I believe.\nIts Not the Stand-Alone Man\nAfter all, what is the difference between men and women? (No, Im not going to open Pandoras box here.) Apart from biological features, whatever differences there are can only be perceived and described in the context of social interaction.\nA man can only be a role model in relation to other human beings. Any boy is born knowing how to use his penis to pee. He doesnt need a male role model for that. He eventually grows his bearsor notwithout a father telling him how to do it.\nHe needs a father figure to teach him how to relate to other people. To other men. To women. To children. To life. He needs a role model to understand himself in relation to others. Notions of identity, self-worth, masculinity arent taught by textbook. They are lived and imitated.\nA father can say a million times Treat your mother with respect!, if he doesnt show respect towards her, his son wont either. This also means, the model is not one person alone. Neither for boys nor for girls. It is the father in relation to the mother (and the mother in relation to the father).\nIts the father in relation to the sisters. A child will observe if the father changes his behavior in the presence of his male friends, his boss, the teacher, and the cleaning lady. They will notice how he treats the homeless, the desperate, the needy, and the unjust. They will see him bowing to authority or standing up for his values. They will see him kicking down or lifting up. The model is the relationship, not the stand-alone person.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nWhen you understand that its easy to see that it is not simply a boy-father question. Its boy-father-mother-girl-andeverybodyelse. Children detect the hypocrisy in their mothers behavior when she talks feminism and lives subjugation. They notice the dynamics between mother and father. Before even the parents are aware of it, children know who plays the victim, who makes the decisions, who controls, manipulates, hides, and yearns.\nThey see the division of labor: who is taking responsibility for the familys emotional well-being, the financial, the material, the intellectual. Who defines the values and who lives them?\nWhat do Women Have to Do with It?\nAm I splitting hairs when I insist that the father figure cannot stand alone? I dont think so. When all we think of is that there has to be a father figure we limit our approach to emotional health to demographics. We overlook the importance of relationships. Its not enough to place a man in front of the child. We have to be aware of how he relates to others. And we, women, have to go very deep into ourselves and be honest about how we relate to men. The man and all others.\nHow do we see ourselves in relation to men? Our husbands, our friends, our fathers, our brothers, our co-workers, the Uber driver, the guy on the street? Do we embrace their presence? Do we fear them, resent them, like them, try to impress them? Does our behavior change the moment a man enters the room? What is our primary way of relating? Protection, seduction, judgment, respect, suspicion?\nDo we warn our daughters that men are dangerous, but of course, Im not talking about your father/brother/grandpa? Do we, consciously or unconsciously, believe that if we lament misogyny loudly with our girlfriends in front of our sons, theyll pick up on how not to be?\nWe cannot create better men by trying to find the holy grail aka perfect father figure and let him do the miracle. We have to rethink our relationships altogether. With ourselves and with our men. And men need to understand that the relationship with their sons is only one of many they have. With themselves, with women, with other men. It all matters.\n",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nIn the uncertain stage between casual dating and a committed relationship, women often analyze mens actions to determine how they truly feel. While astrological signs and personality assessments can provide insight into compatibility, a mans everyday behaviors provide the clearest view into his affection and devotion!\nIn the following, I will focus on these 20 gestures to check whether hes falling deeply for you!\nHe takes care of you\nIf youre tired, sick, or simply have a lot going on, he makes an effort to ease your burdens. Whether bringing soup when youre ill, giving a foot massage after youve been on your feet all day or simply asking what he can do to help, his acts of service show how much your well-being means to him and that hes there to support you whenever needed.\nHe takes action\nRather than just talking about how he feels, he puts in the effort to make you feel special. Whether planning unique dates or small spontaneous acts of service like cooking your favorite meal after a long day, his actions show youre on his mind and he wants to make you smile.\nHe joins your life\nWhen a man is interested in a woman, he wants to be part of as many aspects of her world as shell allow. Check if he replies to your social media updates, attends events with your friends or family, or joins in with your hobbies or causes. By sharing parts of your daily life, hes demonstrating his interest in understanding and connecting with all stuff that is important to you.\nHe declares publicly\nIf he posts about you on social media, features photos of the two of you on his profiles, or introduces you to friends as his girlfriend, hes openly claiming you and wants others to recognize you as a couple. Showing you off to the world signifies immense pride in having you by his other half!\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nHe makes eye contact.\nWhen talking with you, he looks you in the eye, showing hes fully present and engaged. Extended eye contact also releases oxytocin, the love hormone, which increases feelings of connection. By gazing into your eyes, hes wordlessly conveying his affection and desire for closeness.\nHe remembers those important firsts\nWhether your two first date, first kiss or first time saying I love you, if he recognizes and commemorates important firsts youve shared, hes purposefully building memories and emotional connections. Bringing up specific details from those initial moments shows how brightly those memories still shine for him and how much more he wants to experience with you.\nHe is jealous, in a healthy way\nWhile excessive jealousy can signal a problematic imbalance of power or lack of trust, minor jealousy shows he cares about your attention and affection. If hes a bit disgruntled hearing about dates who came before him or unhappy with guys hitting on you in public, youre mean to him and he wants to feel secure in winning and keeping your heart.\nHe says good morning/goodnight every day\nBeyond basic greetings, he kicks off and concludes each day by reaching out to say hes thinking of you. Whether wishing you a productive day or saying he hopes you sleep well, the daily check-ins reveal youre often on his mind.\nHe gives small gifts\nRather than showering you with extravagant presents, he gifts tokens large and small to show he pays attention to your preferences, needs, and the little details that fill your days. Whether your favorite coffee and snack, a flower picked from your yard, or a note to brighten your morning, the gifts are reflections of his observant nature and desire to bring more sweetness and joy into your daily life.\nHe helps with chores\nWhen you two are living together, doing chores or errands without asking shows he looks for ways to be useful and make your life easier. By helping around the home or taking care of pesky tasks, hes showing that the little details of your life are important to him too and he wants to lighten your load whenever possible.\nHe makes you laugh\nSharing jokes, funny stories, or being silly together shows he enjoys bringing more joy and laughter into your days. Watching you laugh and sharing in laughter together releases endorphins that strengthen your bond and shows he prioritizes keeping things light and fun.\nHe stands up for you\nNot only to make you laugh but also to be there when you cry. Whether defending you in an argument or disagreement with others or supporting you in difficult life situations, hes there to have your back. Standing up for you shows he respects you and is committed to looking out for your best interests.\nHe cleans up\nIf he puts in the effort to tidy his space or appearance for your benefit, hes showing he wants to put his best self forward to please you. Making an effort to organize his environment or freshen up shows he cares about your impressions and comfort.\nHe cares about appearance\nNot just space around but also his appearance. Styling his hair, wearing cologne, or putting extra attention into what he wears shows he wants to look and smell good for your pleasure. While loving someone means appreciating them however they present themselves, making an effort to be well-groomed proves he wants to feel confident and attractive for your benefit.\nHe asks thoughtful questions\nShowing interest in your life, thoughts, feelings, and experiences through open-ended questions proves hes genuinely curious about understanding all that makes you who you are. Questions that go deeper than small talk show hes fully invested in continuously learning more about you.\nHes physically affectionate\nWith casual touches, hugs, and holding hands, he finds excuses to maintain physical contact. Simple touches release oxytocin, strengthen emotional bonds, and convey the desires of your nearness and the pleasure of touch even in quiet moments together.\nHe mirrors you\nWhether mimicking your gestures, facial expressions, or speech patterns, unconsciously matching you shows hes fully in tune with you and invested in connecting on multiple levels. Synchronizing with you physically and vocally signifies high comfort, interest, and affection.\nHe introduces you to the family\nInviting you to family events or making introductions shows he sees you as someone who may become a permanent part of his life and inner circle. Including you in occasions with the people closest to him signifies he trusts you, feels proud and comfortable to share you with others who are important to him and may envision a future where you join and bond with his family.\nHe compromises\nWhen deciding how to spend time together, he considers your preferences, needs, and interests as equal to his own. Whether choosing a restaurant, planning a vacation, or making other decisions as a couple, he values you and your input, recognizing a healthy relationship involves compromise from both sides. His willingness to meet you in the middle shows he cares about your happiness and building a partnership based on fairness.\nDont like ",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nThere are numerous benefits to owning a home, including independence and the opportunity to fully customize your living space. Maintaining your home, however, can be a lot of work and is one reason many people\nconsider renting instead\n. A house is a lot of responsibility but is also considered the ideal goal in our idea of the American dream.\nSo dont let the task of maintaining a household deter you from homeownership. Instead, simply implement some tricks for making the upkeep smother and less of a hassle. After all, your home should be where you feel safe and relaxed, not stressed and overworked. Its easy to get frustrated with the attention and time you must put into your home, but it can also be easy to simplify things and make them far more manageable.\nOutside In\nWhile the interior of the house may be your main focus, the outside can be just as important so you should make sure youre not neglecting it. Depending on where you live and how much property you own exterior upkeep can be a big job, but its a requirement. How your home looks from the outside is a huge factor for\nproperty value\nnot just for your own house but for others in the neighborhood as well.\nMaintaining the lawn of your home is extremely important to keep the grass healthy, manageable, and aesthetically clean. Some neighborhoods even have a required length of grass so maintaining it is a must. Take a look at your exterior space and determine what needs to be done so you can make a\nlawn care schedule\n. Decide when and how often to cut the grass, trim any bushes, pull weeds, and anything else that may need to be done.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nYou can also consider starting a garden. Not only will this add to the look of your homes exterior but it can be very beneficial as well. You can plant fruit or vegetables to eat, herbs for seasonings and teas, or flowers to attract and help out pollinators like bees and butterflies. Plus, gardening can be\nincredibly therapeutic\nand can help give your outdoor space a sense of beauty and tranquility.\nAnother great way to utilize your homes exterior is by creating an outdoor living space. You can set up all kinds of outdoor furniture to create an area where you can entertain guests or just relax. Get a table, chairs, and a grill for a nice barbecue area, or set up a hammock under some shade for a cozy napping spot. You could even consider getting a pool if your home doesnt already have one or putting in a fire pit for relaxing nights under the stars.\nNeat and Tidy\nOwning a home means being responsible for everything running smoothly and efficiently. From the plumbing to the electricity to cable and internet, there can be a lot of different things to manage. And if your home is larger it can be even more of a task to not only keep everything in working order but also to keep everything sparkling clean.\nA big mistake many homeowners make is waiting until something breaks or stops working to fix it, which can increase your stress as well as the expense of replacements or repairs. Familiarize yourself with your home and every appliance and machine in it. You dont have to become an expert on maintenance of course, but you should at least know the basics of how things work so you can spot when things begin to run less efficiently. If you notice something isnt working how it should, dont ignore it. Do your research and call a specialist right away so the small problem doesnt become a\nmajor one\n.\nIn addition to everything working smoothly, everything in your home should be clean as well. Whether you find cleaning to be relaxing or cant stand it, its an important part of owning a home and should be done thoroughly. Take the time to try out different cleaning products to find which is best for your houses needs, find some easy cleaning\ntricks and hacks\n, and create a schedule to keep yourself on track. You can dedicate a day to cleaning the house or schedule some time each day for cleaning different areas.\nMake Your House a  While your home must be functional, it should be comfortable and personalized as well. A house shouldnt be just a shelter where you sleep away from the elements. It should be a space to call your own, a place where you can live and entertain, a place that makes you happy.\nYou should set up your home to be convenient and functional according to your needs. If you dont really need a guest room turn it into an office or a craft room for your hobbies instead. If you have a pet, be sure to create spaces for them where they can play and rest comfortably. Not everyone needs the same things out of a house. Orient your space for what best suits you and your lifestyle.\nNever be afraid to add your\npersonal touches\nanywhere and everywhere. Its your home and it should reflect who you are and how you like to live. Choose artwork that inspires you, paint the walls your favorite colors, and pick furniture that youll be most comfortable on. You can tailor everything to your personal aesthetic and make your home unique to you. Get creative and have fun setting up your living space.\nA happy home is one that is clean, functional, convenient, and one that speaks to who you are and the things you like. Your house shouldnt be just a building, but an extension of you and your lifestyle. You can find so many ways to make your house feel more like home and more relaxing and fun than stressful. Home is where the heart is, so put your heart into caring for your home.\n",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\nI try to pay attention. I only see what I look at, but I try to look. It seems so many people dont always want to see. Life is simpler if you only look at things that make you comfortable.\nIn our neighborhood there are a lot of dog owners. Many of them walk their dogs carrying their phones in front of them, a shield to keep the world at a comfortable distance. Life speeds past them, while their dogs stop and smell every mailbox post, dandelion patch, errant clump of broadleaf grass. The look with fascination at every passing car. Dogs see everything, they are interested in everything, most of them seem to smile as they walk down the street.\nThere is nothing happier than a dog going for a walk. Some of them almost wave at you as you drive past, sometimes they bark, angry youre driving down their street. They always put on a show, a circus. Some of them seem to drag their walker from one scent to the next, others just  Most times their owners dont notice, they dont see.\nI walk downtown streets at lunch, and I see hundreds of people, they dont see me. It seems they dont see anybody. Locked in, they carry their anonymity around as plain to see as the identity card hanging on a lanyard around their neck. They exist as part of a group. Each one is an individual, but still gather strength from membership in a mass of moving parts. You learn to fit in, adjusting with the swells and rolls, it seems like chaos, but it works.\nOne day, while I was walking past the landscaping that surrounds the entrance to the elevated skywalk over Nationwide Boulevard it stopped working.\nThere was a gaunt, middle aged black man, wearing a dress. His skin was spotted, peeling from psoriasis, his hair was patchy and gray. He was picking up trash from the bushes and flowers. There were blossoms on the flowers and buds forming on the bushes. All the empty cups and food wrappers were a blight. I had never noticed how ugly they were, how offensive the trash looked until some of them were gone. I know the city pays people to come around and clean up the litter, but it always seems to be there, a constant ugly nuisance. Until this person decided to do something about it. He was climbing out when I walked up.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nHello, how are you? He asked. Smiling with pride. His bag of litter, hanging loosely over his left wrist, like a pocketbook.\nIm doing well. That looks great. Thanks. I said, waving my hand to indicate the one clean area in the landscaping. It was bright, and wholesome, the flowers seemed taller, and a little more colorful. They didnt have to compete with the empty paper cups, gaudy with a colorful chicken, sandwich wrappers and bright, garish energy drink cans.\nThanks, Im glad you like it. He said, his smile grew, slightly, he was missing a few teeth. He turned and walked away, and I wondered how he had managed to clean it up wearing high heels.\nHe was a light, the beautiful possibility of spontaneous volunteerism, shining through the fog of urban indifference. His light was powerful, beautiful, it held the whole spectrum of noble humanity. As far as I could tell nobody saw him, he was invisible, despite the fashionable red dress and the matching heels, despite the sparkling clean area between the sidewalk and the first stanchion, he didnt exist. I had a feeling he didnt exist in a lot of ways, to a lot of organizations. He was just a ghost in the machine. Forgotten.\nLife is a mess, everywhere you look. There are always bright spots in the darkness, rays of hope. You can see it shining in the face of two beagles, looking happy, contented, out for a slow walk, their leashes trailing under a cell phone. Or someone feeling so much pride for tackling litter one bag at a time. Its just a good idea to keep your eyes and your mind open, and enjoy the lights, the stars, particularly the ones that have a few flaws.\n",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\nI think that I am awesome. There was a study that recently came out that confirmed this fact. I was the only participant, but lets not get stuck in the process. Lets just accept the results. Im so confident that being overconfident is one of my fatal flaws. It is entirely possible that you will read about my death one day as Man builds his own rocket because how hard could it be?\nThere is a fine line between confidence and stupidity. Im still trying to figure it out.\nBut that is the view of me that most people get to see in public. When Im speaking or writing, that confidence comes through. What people dont see are the moments when that confidence has evaporated. They dont get a chance to witness the self-pity and doubt that have plagued me my entire life. And more importantly, the monumental failures that I turn into heroic stories. In those, I have the confidence that sometimes I dont feel.\nFor the most part, this has worked out. Its a life skill that has opened new doors. That confidence is what helps me pick myself up when I fail. Thats what Im trying to teach to my teenagers. Im finding it almost impossible.\nAt times, teaching our children confidence seems like a long shot at best. The nature vs. nurture debate comes up, as well as personalities, assertiveness, and a whole list of other things. And so many of these things seem out of a fathers control. They are abstract ideas without clearly defined goals and paths.\nNot to mention why confidence is even important to begin with. Well, not to get too far in the weeds, but confidence helps with mental health, relationships, self-worth, and a whole other list of needs that haunt our teenagers. Thats why confidence is important; it makes them a better version of themselves.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nIn its essence, confidence is rooted in how we deal with failure. A failure of self, a failure of expectations, and a failure of performance. For something that I use so much to succeed, Ive learned confidence much more from falling flat on my face.\nThis means as a father, Im not teaching my kids confidence. Im teaching my kids how to fail, and that is the difficult part.\nNone of us want to see our teenagers fall. We want to provide as much emotional safety as we do physical safety. These are the little people that rely on us and its a job that many of us take very seriously. But to help them, we need to push them out into the world knowing that they will get eaten alive at times. And we must be ok with that. That is our mental struggle, and honestly, I dont know if Im doing a good job of it as of yet.\nI see a lot of failures in my future, but I think I have the confidence to face them. And thats the most important thing my children need to see. I dont think you can teach it any other way than by example. No matter how many books we read, Ted Talks we recommend, or sports stars we hang up on our wallsteaching how to face failure and bounce back from it requires individual experience. Our teens can get some of that experience by modeling our own behavior.\nWhich means we have to show our kids our own risks, both the good ones and the bad ones. We have to invite them to watch us fall flat on our faces and then show them how we dust ourselves off. And many of us can do this because we have done it so, so many times before. My first book The Ultimate Stay-at-Home Dad Manual is basically a highlight reel of my failures.\nIn our own stories, we are the hero but that is not always what our kids need. Men have been trained to be stoic, to take it on the chin, and to win. Half the time we cant even define what that win looks like. But it is ingrained into us. And it takes everything in my being to not be that guy. To be vulnerable in front of my kids. They dont always need the hero. Sometimes they need the clueless loser.\nLuckily, Im pretty good at being that guy as well. Its very possible that I am wrong, but after fifteen years of being the primary caregiver to my kids, I dont think so. I dont think so because like I said in the beginning, I am awesome.\nI dont have to be confident that I am right. I just have to be confident to admit when Im wrong and learn from the mistake. And that is the ultimate lesson we need to teach our teenagers.\n\nThe Ultimate Stay-at-Home Dad manual\ntakes the best advice and wisdom from a dads group, and puts it into a format to help new stay-at-home fathers. Characterized by actionable and direct advice to fathers, the book takes on parenting from a fathers point of view and encourages dads to use their natural talents to become a better parent. That advice is further bolstered by an additional 57 other dads who also give advice. All this advice is framed by the authors personal stories, which help the reader connect with the content and drives the advice home. This is a book that takes on day-to-day parenting, not just as a stay-at-home dadworking fathers could benefit from this book as much as at-home dads.\n",

      "description": "And why you should take care when someone says I love you.",
      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nThe purpose of a relationship is not to have another who might complete you, but to have another with whom you might share your completeness.\n Neale Donald Walsch\nHuman beings are social creatures, and relationships are an essential part of our lives. We seek companionship, love, and intimacy, and we use labels to define our relationships with others. We use terms like boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife, friend, and acquaintance to categorize our connections. However, these labels do not always accurately describe the complexity and depth of our relationships. In this article, we will discuss the fallacy of relationship labels and why they dont define your connection.\nRelationship labels are limiting.\nRelationship labels can be limiting because they are often based on societal norms and expectations. For example, a romantic relationship is typically expected to lead to marriage, and a friendship is often seen as less important than a romantic partnership. These expectations can put unnecessary pressure on individuals to fit into a certain mold or to conform to specific roles in their relationships.\nFurthermore, relationships are constantly evolving, and labels can become obsolete or inaccurate over time. For example, a couple may start out as friends with benefits and then develop deeper feelings for each other, leading to a more significant commitment. In this case, the label of friends with benefits no longer accurately describes the relationship.\nRelationship labels can also be ambiguous, and people may interpret them differently. For example, some people may use the term friends to describe a close, intimate relationship, while others may use the same term to describe a casual acquaintance.\nRelationship labels are subjective.\nRelationship labels are subjective because they are based on individual perceptions and experiences. What one person considers a romantic relationship may be seen as a platonic friendship by another. Therefore, the labels we use to define our relationships may not be universal or shared by everyone involved.\nMoreover, relationships are complex and multifaceted, and one label cannot capture the full extent of our connections. For example, a couple may be romantic partners, but they may also be best friends, confidants, and intellectual equals. Therefore, using a single label to define their relationship would not accurately represent its complexity.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nRelationship labels can be misleading.\nRelationship labels can be misleading because they imply a level of commitment or intimacy that may not exist. For example, someone may refer to another person as their significant other, implying a committed romantic relationship, when in reality, they are casually dating or not exclusive.\nFurthermore, labels can create false expectations and assumptions about a relationship. For example, if someone refers to another person as their best friend, they may assume that they are the most important person in that persons life, which may not be the case.\nConclusion\nRelationship labels can be useful in certain contexts, such as setting boundaries or communicating expectations. However, they should not be relied on as a definitive measure of the depth or quality of a relationship. Relationships are complex and multifaceted, and they cannot be accurately defined by a single label. Instead, we should focus on cultivating authentic connections with others and appreciate the unique qualities and nuances of each relationship.\n",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nYou might not know it from our physical appearance, but some of us can carry an entire relationship on our shoulders for months or even years at a time.\nWe are the friends/siblings/romantic partners who take charge of keeping the lines of communication open; monitoring every slight alteration in the other persons mood and adjusting our behavior accordingly; and suppressing our own needs to focus exhaustive energy on what we can do for the person we care about. We do this hoping to receive love and consideration in return, of course, but we will keep doing it long after the other person stops putting in effort.\nIronically, all that heavy lifting doesnt make us stronger; instead, it often makes our sense of self frail and sickly. And heres the worst part: in the end, it usually fails anyway  because a relationship can only exist for so long when one person is doing all the maintenance work.\nWhen an unbalanced relationship (romantic or otherwise) ends, it can feel like a personal failure on the part of the individual who was more actively invested. We wonder, If I gave this my all, and it still wasnt good enough, what does that say about me? Perhaps I myself am not good enough in some fundamental way.\nBut let me assure you of something I have learned, then forgotten, then relearned several times over the years: Your relationships are not a mirror of your worth and your lovability. All they reflect is the particular combination of two very unique people. One of those people is you, and the other is someone over whom you have no control. I repeat, NO control.\nAny relationship has its periods where one person puts in more effort than the other. The problem starts when that becomes the default mode. And for those of us who are anxious, or people pleasers, or frightened when we feel a lack of control, or perfectionists, or survivors of past relationship trauma, or all of the abovewell, its all too easy to continue bridging the gap and hoping we can fix things and bring the balance back. We become the workhorses of the relationship.\nDuring times in my life when I felt an inexplicable emptiness, I looked to certain friendships or romantic pursuits to fill the void. Those relationships, I believed, were a mirror that would tell me deep truths about myself and my worth. If one began to falter, instead of recognizing that not all relationships are meant to last, I took the shift as a sign that I was doing something wrong. And if I was the problem, I could be the solution as well, so I doubled or tripled my efforts.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nIll fast-forward to the end of each of those stories and tell you that approach didnt work. It was depleting and damaging and wasted a lot of precious time. Relationships live or die based on the actions of both participants. One person can hold things together for a while, but not forever, and the quality of the relationship in the meantime will rapidly deteriorate.\nThe truth is, if our partner returns to meet us halfway, its because they made the choice to start showing up again in the relationship. We cant really take credit for their renewed effort. And if they choose to keep putting in the bare minimum, guess what? We cant take blame for that.\nTry to let that sink in. Your partner/friend/relative is going to change for the better, or they are going to keep doing exactly what theyve been doing and make only surface-level investments in the relationship. Thats not under your control. Believing otherwise will lead to misery and utter exhaustion.\nIf you want to direct your energy in a productive way, focus it on figuring out what youre fighting so hard to get from this other person. Then work on meeting those needs without involving anyone else. The only relationship that directly reflects your worth is the one you have with yourself.\n",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nAs scholars, how do we decide what to work on? If you have a job and a boss and they assign you to a project, setting your agenda is relatively straightforward. But if you are a graduate student or academic researcher, with control over your time and priorities, its on you to decide. Its good to be purposeful about this rather than drift, because small choices made without careful consideration can snowball into multiyear commitments and, potentially, dead ends or other traps. Also, being willing and able to change your mind is very important.\nIn our sociology department, we assign students to write a second-year paper, to be completed by the end of their fourth semester of training. That usually mean identifying a topic sometime in the second semester and working on it for about a year. The reason I like this structure, rather than a thesis model with an open-ended timeline, is because it lets people exit a project after a year. Because choosing a project is hard, especially in your first year of grad school, its good to have an exit ramp if it doesnt turn out to be a good long-term project.\nThe problem of identifying projects to work on is an underappreciated challenge at all career stages, but the stakes are higher when you have clocks running for funding, jobs, and promotion. Here is a way of categorizing the issues: The Three Cs.\nCommunity (or caring, or concern)\nWhat topic or research question matters to you and your human community? Community can be imagined here on a scale from a family to a town, a gender, an ethnic group, or the global community. If your findings wont speak to something that moves you  in your social role  that helps you find a place of contribution to the larger society, then it is unlikely to be satisfying and motivating. It is a source of connection that humanizes your work, your career, and your life. This is more meaningful than the superficial \npolicy implications\n sociologists often talk about in a perfunctory way. Of course things that matter socially often matter for policy, too, but if your research wont speak to a specific policy question or debate right now, thats fine. If it matters to your human community, thats important.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nCuriosity\nYou have to want to know the answer to your research question  and not know it already. Otherwise, its probably not that important and almost definitely will be boring. If your intention with research is to show something, thats not a bad thing. Maybe the thing you are showing is true and important  but its limiting. Discovery is the lifeblood of the researching mind. There is lots of valuable intellectual work to do communicating important knowledge to people who need it, and thats often an important part of our jobs. But thats not research. Research is about finding answers.\nCareer\nDont jump straight here. I mean, you can, but its sad. You want your work to mean something to your academic discipline, to your peers, to your university overlords, to publishers and the media. Topic choice (and findings) drive a lot of attention from these sources, which can make all the difference for getting jobs, raising money, getting promotions, winning awards, achieving high status, and getting a self-driving car. And you might need to work on a topic someone else has chosen just to keep your funding in graduate school. But a career-enhancing topic also makes your work more rewarding in other ways, socially and intellectually, because its fun and interesting to talk about, and gives you a source of connection with other people in the field. So if the topic you care most about  that you are dying to understand, that only you can figure out  is just poison in the profession or the intellectual marketplace, you need to compromise and find a way to make it fit in better. Otherwise it may be your last research project before you have to find another line of work. And making the right choice can open a lot of doors.\nIdentifying the Three Cs is easier than weighting them in your decision making. But your personal formula needs to include some assessment of these elements.\n",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nI spent the majority of my adult life with one person. We were in a long-term relationship and things didnt work out so it all ended. Coming out of an unhealthy long-term relationship, it is fair to say I fumbled a lot. I had no experience of navigating the dating scene.\nI had my share of meet and never see again people, emotionally unavailable people, and some weird interactions. I had to do further investigation into why I am attracting certain types of people. After doing some reading and soul searching I made a vow not to date anymore or meet anyone because I was so tired. However, one day as fate would have it I came across a person on my profile and his bio was about how to make the best hummus. As a hummus enthusiast myself I reached out to him and had a short chat in the middle of the night.\nFor some reason, I contacted him the next day. The man expressed interest in meeting for dinner and felt pushy. When a guy pushes for a plan, I usually see them as needy and get turned off. I didnt want to have dinner and lead him on to more so I cut it short and said he is welcome to see me at the cafe because I was working from there. I was so distracted by my work I didnt even realize it when he texted. Unlike other guys, I had met prior he kept on updating me on his ETA. It felt a bit odd to me but I didnt think much and carried on with my work.\nAfter a while, there came a guy with a backpack. I still remember when I looked up to wave at him he had this friendly smile almost inviting and warm. He smiled and came to sit beside me. He felt different, but it was nice. I dont know what it was. I felt like I didnt have to pretend to be anything. He would let me talk and listen to what I had to say. His aura was so clean and warm. He would show me his work and share his geeky side. I come from a non-technical background and I didnt want to appear less knowledgeable so I just listened.\nWe would do our work and chat in between and share coffee. My roommate came to sit with us too and we had a pleasant conversation. He followed us to dinner and my roommate left to attend to her thing. We kept on moving from one place to another and the first date that I thought I didnt want to be turned into 10+ hours.\nAs he was in my city for a week, we frequented our meetings, spending more than 8 hours each time. This was so different from all my dates before. I actually enjoyed being around this person. Our date consisted of just walking and talking for hours and hopping around places. He was working and also taking some classes. Therefore, he would often come with his laptop and I would wait for him to finish his class to hang out with him.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nOne of my fondest memories is when we visited a rooftop restaurant at dusk, with the sky almost turning dark and the stars and moon clearly visible above us. I had my overly-priced cocktail in hand and he was on my side attending his online class. I felt so much at ease and at peace in his presence. I remember taking a deep sigh and thinking  maybe I wouldnt mind dating someone like him. I started imagining living with someone like him and sharing our days. I loved how easy it was with him but since he was leaving soon I had no further expectations (maybe it was my way of keeping myself safe).\nDuring our time together, I felt so magical. I am never shy or scared to meet people but I actually cared about how he thought of me. I had no guts to hold his hand or even sit near him. Besides feeling so warm, he expressed his sadness at leaving me.\nThe day before he left I joined him for a concert and hung out with friends. I gathered all my guts and leaned on him during the concert. He might have noticed it but didnt go further. We leaned into each other in an awkward manner. With the help of a drink, I finally managed to hold his hand after the concert. I still remember how warm it felt. On our way to the house, we grabbed dinner and I semi-hugged him. I dont know why I was so nervous. On our way home we were walking behind our friends in the alley. It was nighttime and as usual, I was talking and he was listening. While walking, I noticed him approaching me with a big smile. I knew what was about to happen but I didnt move. He slowly reached toward me grabbed my face and kissed me ever so gently. Although I did kiss him back, I found myself mostly frozen. After our kiss, he kissed my nose, leaving me in awe. I couldnt recall anyone kissing my nose before.\nLater we shared pizza and checked into a hotel. After a week I finally hugged him properly. His hug was like warm sunshine in cold weather. He was very affectionate, and since I had been lacking physical contact, his touch felt incredibly nourishing. Since everything had been so perfect, I didnt want to ruin the moment, so we simply shared a hug and left to sleep.\nI recently came across an article that suggested that if a girl likes a guy, she has no intention of sleeping with him right away, and I found that to be true in my case. I was content with his company and the comfort of his hugs, and our dates had been so restorative that I didnt desire anything more. I thought I would never see him again and I was completely fine with it. He was the first nice guy I dated. Something about him just soothed my soul. I felt like I could breathe around him. I felt safe enough to be me.\nComing from a history of toxic relationships and emotionally unavailable partners, he was a breath of fresh air for me. I didnt even know what I was missing until I met him. We checked out in the morning and I bid goodbye. I believed that was the end of our interaction, but fate seemed to have other plans, as we kept in touch and continued to meet repeatedly.\nI once heard someone say, No one talks about how unsettling it can be when transitioning from a toxic relationship to a stable one. This could not be further from the truth. We have been together for a few months and I have had my fair share of battling my demons. Its almost like you dont know how to behave at times. After being accustomed to neglect and harsh treatment, experiencing calmness felt surreal. I was usually the one who got triggered and acted in a toxic manner. Regardless of what happened, he was always there for me, and I found myself returning to him time and time again.\nIn a few months, he will be leaving for overseas. Part of me feels sad and part of me feels happy for him. I met him when I said I didnt want to see anyone. He came into my life to show me how it feels to date a nice guy. Even when I encountered someone I was interested in, I felt uncomfortable and uneasy. With him, everything felt easy. I could tell him exactly how I felt and he would listen. He would never react with anger and would never step behind to say sorry.\nHe helped me relive my childhood fantasies. I had seen in movies how a guy would come up behind a girl while she was cooking and hug her, and they would ",

They become certain of their every error. In addition to grieving all that has happened they now prosecute themselves for the past negligence they believe they are surely guilty of.\nMaybe youve been there.\nMaybe youre there right now.\nMaybe youre mourning the end of something and wondering if you did the best that you could.\nYou probably did.\nEven if you now look back on a situation or conversation and imagine you could have been wiser or more forgiving or kinder or betteryou likely couldnt have. Given what you knew and how you felt and how much pain you were in and how tired you were and what was in front of you, that decision was the only one you could have made. Regardless of how poorly you now judge your performance, it was the best that you could do.\nAs much as we want to, we dont get to live life in the rearview mirror. We cant look back and imagine that we would respond differently, because time has allowed us just enough space and perspective and wisdom as to be safely outside of our past circumstances and to see them differently:\nWe can now critique former ourselves as some detached observer:\nWe see every red flag that was invisible to us.\nWe notice the defensiveness and selfishness we were oblivious to.\nWe spot every careless and damaging word before we speak it.\nWe foresee every stumble and misstep.\nWe sidestep all our approaching failures.\nBut thats not how you got here. You didnt get to stand back and watch it all from a distance. You went through those painful, difficult things in real-time. You crawled through the noisy, jagged trenches of your sadness and fatigue and fear, and you gutted it out the only way you knew how.

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nWe add a lot of extra thinking and stress. We add a bunch of extra steps. We put things off for a long time, so that it becomes so much more stressful. We worry about things we cant control, or cant know about (like what other people think of us).\nThese are all protective mechanisms  were trying to keep ourselves safe. But in most cases, its not needed.\nLets look at some examples of how we typically make things harder for ourselves:\nTheres an email in my inbox that requires a few steps before I can reply. Instead of doing those steps, I put it off, because of a belief that I have too much to do. It lingers in my inbox for a week. A bunch of other emails do that too. Im so overwhelmed by this that I keep putting off all the emails. What could be a simple set of small steps ends up becoming an unconquerable mountain.\nI have some planning to do for a trip  and I worry about all the possible things that could come up, not sure what to expect, not sure what people will think of me. It feels overwhelming so I put it off while worrying about it for weeks. It could be a simple act of booking a flight and a room, and packing, but it becomes a lot of anguish.\nI have a million things to do on my todo list. Instead of simply doing the next thing on the list, I jump around from one thing to the next, panic about not being able to do it all, distract myself for awhile, making myself feel overwhelmed and stressed.\nPlanning for a social gathering at my house becomes an exercise in worrying and overpreparing, spending days getting everything ready. Instead, it could be a simple act of getting some food and drinks and tidying up a bit.\nYou can see that for each of these examples, Ive shared a way that it could be simple and easeful. But we layer complexity, worrying, overwhelm, distraction, avoidance, stress, overthinking, overpreparing, anticipating.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nWhat would it be like to just do things as simply as possible?\nHow to Do Things With Greater Ease\nSome good questions to ask when youre doing anything are:\n1. How am I making this harder?\n2. How could I do it as simply and easefully as possible?\n3. How would I do this if I trusted myself?\nSo for example:\nIf you are creating something  if you trusted yourself and didnt have to worry about whether youd be judged, how would you create and put it out into the world? For me, its much more easeful this way, just creating and releasing my creations.\nIf you dont have time to deal with an email or message right now  could you make some time later in the day or in the week to deal with the messages that will take a little more time?\nInstead of worrying about all the things you have to do and getting stuck in overwhelm about all of it  could you just focus on the next task?\nIf youre worrying about what you said in a recent conversation  what if you simply trusted and focused instead on whats in front of you?\nIn preparing for something coming up, what if you could just trust yourself and do it as simply as humanly possible?\nIf youre piling guilt on top of yourself  what if you released that and gave yourself compassion instead?\nIf you are piling expectations and stress on yourself  what if you released all of that and just put yourself fully into whatever you do?\nIf youre avoiding and distracting, adding a lot of extra stress on top of things  what if you just did the smallest next step and trusted yourself?\nIf youre overthinking and getting stuck in worry and indecision  what if you simply got lost in the doing?\nWhat if you brought a sense of play, ease, adventure, curiosity, joy, love to everything you did?\nThis is a lifelong practice, but its so beautiful. I wish you simplicity and ease.\n\nThis post was previously published on Zen Habits. Uncopyright courtesy Leo Babauta.\n***",

      "body": "Unlike many videos on this list, this short clip was created for suspense versus captured live. Regardless, it scares us all the same and is perfect for those looking for a scare without watching an entire movie-length film.\n2. Possible Fallen Angel in Catalonia\nWhile not a very long video, this one-minute clip shows just how spooky a remote forest can be. Pictured is a strange, \"real life\" ghost or creature sitting and roaming around in Catalonia's Campdevnol.\n3. Ghost from Japanese Subway\nWhat's scarier than riding on the subway during rush or peak hours? Sharing that ride with the undead.\nA ghost sitting in the Japanese subway is brought to life with this short clip, detailing a ghost coming to life after jumping in front of a train. While not a short-clip film created for YouTube or a real sighting, this segment from Ura Horror is sure to make your hair stand up.\n4. Ghost in a Shop\nYou'll never know what happens behind closed doors unless, of course, you have 24-hour surveillance.\nThis video of a shop after-hours shows movement said to be prompted by paranormal activity. Perhaps ghosts? With over 9 million views, it must have created at least some believers.\n5. While You Were Sleeping\nFrom \"The Daily Mail,\" this is beyond the frightening video of spooky activity happening while a woman sleeps. When we shut our eyes, we're blinded to any spirits that may be hanging around us, leaving us extremely vulnerable and making this video extra scary.\n6. The Spooky Halloween\nHalloween is apparently not just a day to binge-watch scary movies and dress up as your favorite character or celebrity. It's a day when all ghostly spirits crawl the Earth... apparently. In this scary video, a ghost can be seen lurking the Morialta Falls in Australia.\n7. Still Clocking In\nWe all need to work hard to bring home the bacon... apparently even ghosts. In this scary yet surprisingly comical and bizarre video, a ghost is seen acting as a warehouse janitor. Make sure to pay him overtime.\n8. Narrow Halls\nIn almost every major horror film or scary movie, there seems to be an eerie scene taking place in a hallway. Hello, \"The Shining,\" anyone? In this clip, the hallway makes its reappearance of housing ghostly spirits.\nRELATED:\nWhat Science & Quantum Physics Say About Whether Or Not Ghosts Are Real\n9. On Route 66\nWhile technically the scariest thing on the road is worrying about the other drivers, runners and cyclists, who thought you'd have to add ghosts to the list?\nTaking place outside of the United States, apparently, a real-life ghost was seen jaywalking/riding a motorcycle into the abyss. We've had our fair share of sci-fi films to know that vanishing is surely an act for the supernatural.\n10. Graveyard Wanderers\nThe first rule of thumb: never enter a graveyard at night. We feel like that's common sense. Why? Because what could be more haunted by ghosts than their body's burial site?\nDon't believe us? Hust watch this very spooky video where ghosts are caught on camera frolicking through the tombstones.\n11. The Haunting Tape\nWe all want to feel like we're safe in our own homes, but when you start to stir up ghostly spirits you may get more than you bargained for. In this video, the commentator is visited by an unwelcome guest, another spirit.\nIs it real or fake? It's up to you to decide (and the other 5.7 million other views).\n12. The Haunting Tape (Part 2)\nSo, ghost spirits have taken over your home. You're safe to get some air, right? Apparently not! In this sequel clip, there seem to be spirits lurking within the nature trail. Move aside, giant grizzlies, we're not concerned with you anymore.\n13. Ghost Sightings Caught at Schools\nWhat if (in school) you were just trying to pay attention, get good grades, and potentially go to an exceptional college? Those should be your main priorities, right? Not dodging the paranormal. Unfortunately for these kids, they've seen their fair share of ghostly sightings around campus.\n14. The Gettysburg Ghost\nMany wars and battles have been fought all over the world, some in our very own backyard. While these locations are full of history and lessons to be learned, just remember what lies beneath the surface. If there was ever a place to witness a ghost sighting, Gettysburg would be one of them.\n15. Ghost in the House/Blog Gone Wrong\nWhen you're just trying to be a beauty influencer, and a ghost just has to steal your spotlight... We get it, not everyone is meant to be on camera.\n16. Levitating Girl in Russian Forest\nThis video starts out with an adorable dog, but things get weird real quick when a little girl is seen levitating in the middle of a forest. How is this happening? The girl ends up running away once she lands, but it's still incredibly creepy.\n17. Ghost Attacks School Lockers\nThere's one angry ghost in Deerpark CBS, the oldest and most haunted school on the south side of Cork City, Ireland. And for some reason, this ghost really doesn't like school.\nRELATED:\nThe 150-Year-Old Mystery In The Desert That Some Say Is Proof Of Alien Life\n18. Ghost Throws Plate and Mug at Man\nAnother video from \"The Daily Mail,\" the ghost in this one clearly doesn't want company or to talk to anyone! Instead of egging the ghost on, this guy should have immediately left and not looked back.\n19. Ghost Screaming in a Haunted Hotel\nNot only are the screams in this video absolutely haunting (see what I did there?), but looking at the security footage instills more uneasiness in viewers. You might want to check for hauntings before booking a hotel.\nRelated Stories From YourTango:\n30 Best Terrifying Paranormal Documentaries & Series\n20.

Playing on the Stairs\nThis ghost was caught on a security camera in a family home. The ghost seems to really be into playing on the stairs. Maybe that's how it passed on.\nRELATED:",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nTheres sort of an expectation that when were younger, we will sow our wild oats. We party, drink way too much, and have as many hook-ups as possible (well, some of you people do, anyway.)\nApparently, this sowing of oats is so we can get it all out of our systems, and then happily settle down later on in life. But is it really?\nI was always conflicted when I was younger about how to live. Part of me wanted to be the party animal, to make out with random people at parties. And part of me saw that behaviour in others, and made me shake my head in disgust.\nAs it turns out, I was a fairly boring 20-something. I drank, but not until I was about legal age. I also didnt do any recreational drugs, despite our high school/college being full of them. I definitely did not attend any late-night orgies, and had limited intimate relationships.\nOn the other hand, Im kind of glad I didnt get too crazy in my youth. It could have led to all kinds of problems, such as an unplanned pregnancy (I was not ready to parent anyone at 20, let alone take care of myself.) I also could have had my heart ripped out by some of the young women I didnt date, leaving my emotionally scarred and afraid to date ever again. I also couldve ended up in hospital from over-indulging in vices during wild parties where sexual encounters often arise.\nHowever, I sometimes wonder if I would have turned out differently had I pursued by impulses more in my heyday. Would I have destroyed the emotional (or physical) parts of me that have allowed me to be a dad and husband? Or would I be the same person, without sometimes feeling nostalgic for my earlier years?\nI wanted to know how much research there has been about the outcomes of sowing/not sowing wild oats, and so I did a bit of Googling.\nMore sex partners points to higher marital unhappiness?\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nAs this article points out, the term dates back to early agriculture, relating to the need to weed wild oats to get the best grain crop. Therefore, wild oats are associated with damage and wasted time, notes the source. Well, that seems pretty straightforward.\nAnother article\non the subject lists pros and cons of sowing wild oats. Apparently, giving in to impulsive behaviour in your youth convinces you that youre ready to live an honest life. It also eliminates regret from missing out later in life. I wouldnt say I have regret, but I do think about that time occasionally (obviously, or I wouldnt have written this.)\nThen theres actual research from the Institute for Family Studies. It doesnt use the term sowing wild oats, but points to some patterns based on sexual history.\nApparently, women who have had fewer sex partners report being happier in marriages. In fact, having just one partner ranked the highest on the marriage satisfaction chart.\nThis is a bit hard to digest  I cant imagine any adult only having one partner in their life. I think its good to experience intimacy before marriage, so you can learn how to express it well. However, one explanation offered is that if youve never had sex with anyone else, you have no one to compare it to.\nMeanwhile, women who sowed their wild oats (six to 10 sexual partners) reported lower levels of satisfaction in a monogamous relationship. This one makes a bit more sense to me  if youre the type that likes variety, then marriage could be a bigger challenge.\nBut what about us dudes?\nAs this article from the Good Men Project explains, its not a one-size-fits-all answer. It could depend on the younger mans testosterone levels, and the environments theyre raised in.\nBut it also points to a desire to avoid looking at the past with disappointment. I also believe that some men (present company included), dont want to walk around with regrets nagging at their souls, so getting it in as much as possible is almost life-or-death. Again, this is just the nature of life, writes the author, Amir Campbell.\nThe Institute for Family Studies had some more data on this point, some of which surprised me. As for women, men who report only one sexual partner in their lifetime are more likely to report very happy marriages, notes the source. That kind of dispels the theory that men need to have sex with everything that moves before marriage.\nIn fact, 71% men with one partner ever reported being happily married, which is higher than the same metric for women at 64%. Interestingly, men with multiple sex partners in their history also have less reported marital satisfaction, but not as dramatic of a drop-off between six to 10 partners (62% satisfaction in this range for men, compared to 52% for women.)\nSo, by this data, it seems men can be happy whether they take home many women before marriage, or only have sex with their high school sweetheart that they end up marrying. On the other hand, women seem quite happy with one lifetime partner, but less happy with marriage when theyve slept with multiple partners (especially after four.)\nHeyday is usually a reference to ones glory days, when one partied hard, and had casual relationships. But it doesnt always have to point to the past. It can be any time in your life that you shine the brightest  so perhaps Ive finally reached my heyday in my 40s.\nAfter all, Ive got a partner who loves me and vice versa  as well as a great kid, a loyal pup, steady work, and a mortgage. Im pumping out more art and writing than probably ever. By all accounts, Im doing pretty well. And now is all that really matters.\n",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nIt might just be everyone looking for scraps of money due to the economy slowing down, but this year, I have been screwed by a staggering number of platforms and services I use to run my online business.\nFor nine months, my email service provider overcharged me. As it turns out, they automatically upgrade you when you gain more subscribers, but they dont downgrade you when you lose some. My payment processor and checkout platform casually near-tripled their fees. Meanwhile, the service I use to host my writing course informed me that my free membership for life I had won a few years back will now turn into a pay up like everyone else agreement  and those are just the issues from last month.\nEvery time I was confronted with such news, I got angry. I argued with customer support. I brainstormed what service to switch to. I fantasized about taking them to court. After half a day of stewing in misery, however, I always came to the same conclusion: This is not a fight worth fighting. I can  and should  ignore this problem.\nYes, I gave my email provider a few hundred dollars too many. Paying more fees on digital product sales sucks. And coughing up $1,000/year for what used to be a free service stinks. If I consider what it would take to rectify these situations, however, especially with respect to how much money I make using these services, the unfortunate reality of business kicks in: You only have so many hours in a day, and you need every single one of them to focus on your true mission.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nI can keep arguing with my email service for hours, but I probably still wont get any credit for what I overpaid. Finding an alternative checkout solution, let alone moving all my products, will take days. And dont even get me started on moving a 130+ lesson online course. But you know what? None of these are where I make the bulk of my money  and so none of these problems are worth my mental energy.\nOne way to find focus is to say no to the million directions you could take your project in. Thats hard but necessary. What must follow, however, is maintaining that focus by also saying no to every little distraction that happens along the way. Even if its related to your project, it might still be unimportant. And so your job is to ignore every problem you can afford to ignore.\nWill it blow up my business if I dont fight tooth and nail over a few hundred dollars? No. Will it ruin my budget if I pay triple the fees on 10% of my revenue? No. And will I even sell my online course next year? I have no idea.\nProblems like this are insidious. They feel important, and they get us to blow our fuse by pushing a sensitive button  the money one  but ultimately, theyll just keep us from working on what we really need to work on.\nStaying focused is one of the hardest challenges in life and in business. Dont give up on this challenge prematurely by getting dragged into mud fights outside the actual playing field.\nFor every nagging problem that lands in your inbox, ask: Can I afford to ignore this? And if the answer is yes, go about your day as if nothing had changed. Recession or not, the birds are still singing, and you have work to do.\n\nThis post was previously published on Niklas Gkes blog.\nGrab a copy of Niks new book,\n2-Minute Pep Talks\n2-Minute Pep Talks\nis a collection of 67 jolts of inspiration for more hope, comfort, and love in any situation.

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nWe all hold core beliefs about relationships. Core beliefs are in fact meta beliefs; they cannot be disproved because they are all-encompassing. Here are some core beliefs that I meet in the clinic every day: Your pain is my fault. Your joy is my responsibility. If you loved me you would know what Im feeling. And more. Such core beliefs leave couples somewhat fused, and their individual and relational growth is often stunted.\nThere is another rigid core belief that prevents couples from evolving in the relationship:\nYour wish is my command.\nIf your partner desires something, it is on you to fulfill it. Many of us (especially women) have been socialized that our partners desires are our responsibility to fulfill. The media also creates the expectation that once were in a relationship, all our wishes will be fulfilled by our partner. The danger of such a belief is that it leads to a victim triangle dynamic in which partners shift between the roles of savior, victim, and persecutor.\nWhy? Because with this core belief, every time your partner shares a wish, you are activated and triggered to do something. You are locked into a lose-lose situation. That is, if you dont fulfill your partners wish, you might be seen as cold, not loving, even aggressive (read: persecutor). If you do fulfill their wish, then it creates a dynamic of you constantly working to fulfill their longings, which leads to bitterness and even contempt (read: martyr).\nThe lose-lose bind results in a dynamic in which each partner refrains from sharing their wants, because they dont want to then hear their partners desires. Couples then stop sharing their wants and desires. They start walking on egg shells around each other and dont share their inner world. Subsequently, theres no place in the relationship to dare to dream out loud. This results in a relationship with little play or experimentation and no personal or relational growth.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nHow to celebrate my partners wishes?\nImagine a relationship in which your dreams, faults, desires, shadow, wants, and all are not only accepted but celebrated. Imagine a dynamic in which you two can share wishes and wants openly and freely.\nYou can achieve that.\nLike any change process of core beliefs, moving from a reactive stance to a curious witnessing of your partners desires will require some top-down, fake-it-till-you-make-it work.\nHow do you share your wishes?\nShare this article with your partner and reflect whether you two have the core belief that their wish is your command.\nChoose to believe that cutting the symbiotic emotional umbilical cord will actually give you and your partner an opportunity to grow. You can read more about how to change core beliefs\nhere.\nBefore you share your wishes, give your partner a heads up. Remind them that they dont need to fulfill your wish but only to listen and Let It Land. They dont have to do anything with your wish, just ground themselves and let you meet yourself. After all, intimacy is into-me-see, meeting yourself in the presence of your partner.\nSlowly share your aspirations. Release them in bite sizes. Share different desires you have. Start with the ones that arent connected to your partner (such as wanting to travel, go back to school, go to a concert); that way it will be easier for them to not react. Remember to share and not spew, which might flood and trigger your partner and prevent them from being with you.\nWhen you listen to their longings, breathe and listen. Be curious. Ask questions. Get excited. Remember that it is not on you to fulfill their yearnings; just be an enthusiastic witness to your partner meeting themselves.\nEnjoy and celebrate your partners (and your own) wishes and dreams. Be excited and hopeful with them. Share their enthusiasm and show them youre on the same team.\n\n\nThese steps will help you create an environment in which each partner can meet themselves, dream big, take up space, and dare to be the biggest, best version of themselves. When you remain grounded and open, their wish will stop being your command. Their wish will become a door to their ever-evolving self and desires. Youll be exposed to more and more dimensions and dreams of your partner-which will result in more curiosity, enjoyment, wonder, play, and attraction.\nOnce wishes are expressed openly and valiantly, then your relationship will become a vehicle to fulfill both of your dreams  which is why we choose to be in a relationship to begin with.\nSo are you ready to dream?\n",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nThe human face has about twenty flat skeletal muscles that control different parts of your face, including the forehead, eyebrows, eyelids, nose and nostrils, cheeks, and lips. Facial muscles also called craniofacial muscles, are responsible for facial expressions.\nThis guide explores three differences between male and female facial muscles. Read on.\nFemales Have Frequent Facial Actions to Men\nDid you know women exhibit more frequent facial actions than men? The prevalent facial expressions include smiling, lip corner pulls, and inner and outer brow raises to positive and negative emotional states. And although males and females use the same muscles for facial expressions, women spontaneously express their emotions with their faces.\nDoes that mean men rarely display facial actions? No. A recent study found that men demonstrated brow burrowing and lip corner depressors.\nIt is worth mentioning that most womens facial expressions were more associated with happiness, sadness, and fear, while mens expressions leaned towards anger. This emotional difference may be attributed to social conventions about how each gender should behave. Also, each gender exhibited prolonged facial expressions in their different emotional states.\nMales Have Larger Facial Muscles\nAnother difference between male and female face muscles is their size and movement. Men have larger facial musculature than women, which affects the energy generated when making a facial expression.\nTo better understand this, when a man makes a facial action, his facial muscles cause a significant movement on the involved surface features, resulting in greater facial expressions. This explains why a simple smile on a mans face may appear greater when compared to a womans.\nFacial Ageing Patterns\nFacial muscles weaken with age, changing the facial bone and soft tissues. However, there is a notable difference in how facial aging occurs between males and females.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nFor men, the first notable wrinkles appear on the forehead as opposed to the periorbital lines in women. These fine lines also called crows feet, result from natural eye muscle movements and develop at the outer sides of the womens eyes. Women also get more visible wrinkles under the eyes, near the lower cheeks, and mouth.\nFacial aging in men is due to low testosterone production. Low levels cause loss of masculine features, including decreased cheekbone prominence and a reduced jawline. On the other hand, women undergo facial aging as their bodies produce low estrogen. However, the aging effects appear as fine lines, unlike the deep rhytides prevalent in men.\nHow to Keep Facial Muscles in Shape\nWhether male or female, adopting helpful practices can help strengthen facial muscles. Try any of the following exercises and maintain a consistent routine while at it.\n Mewing\nMewing improves your faces symmetry by strengthening your cheekbones and jawline. This exercise is effective, with notable effects visible between 1 to 6 months. We recommend taking\npictures to track your progress.\n Facial Yoga\nThis exercise firms and tones your facial muscles for better facial expressions. Plus, it improves facial appearance, with visible fullness in the mid and lower face.\n Neck Stretches\nA tight and tense neck can cause tension in your facial muscles, affecting your overall appearance. But stretching your neck from side to side while massaging it can relieve tension.\n Forehead Fine-Tuning\nThis exercise prevents wrinkles from appearing on your forehead. Simply act surprised with your eyes wide open and your forehead frozen. Repeat this at least eight times a day.\nFinal Thoughts\nMales and females have differences in their facial muscles. For starters, females display frequent facial expressions when exposed to happy, sad, and scary scenarios, while men lean toward the angry side. Plus, mens facial muscles are more defined since their faces are more prominent than womens.\n",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nOne of the essential preconditions of a good relationship is having a satisfactory perspective on being single. The more we are happy to be on our own, the more we will be able to exercise the correct degree of caution around finding a new companion. The bedrock of true love is happy singledom.\n\nSocieties do very little to help us calm or at ease in our own company. Singledom is often framed as an involuntary, depressing, and always, hopefully, temporary state. The notion that someone might want or need to be on their own, perhaps for a long while, terrifies a world shaped by legions of silently miserable couples who need confirmation that they have not chosen the wrong path.\nTo enforce the idea of what single people are missing, advertisers can never have enough of showing off tantalising images of happy couples walking hand in hand on beaches. Most entertainment venues, holiday destinations, and social occasions feel compelled to patronise, overcharge, and otherwise demean anyone who has the impotence to venture out on their own.\nUnfortunately, being miserable while single fatally undermines our judgment about whom we might get together with. When someone is starving, they will eat anything. Dostoyevsky wrote a harrowing short story about a famished child who eats a candle made of pig fat. We are equally liable for emotional desperation. To run into the nearest nightclub to secure a chump/muppet who will be appalled to find beside us at daybreak, we eventually learn that being in an unsatisfactory relationship is clearly worse and even more lonely than being alone.\n\nThe central challenge of being alone is coping with the fear of what singlehood means. Being alone is bearable in relation to how normal that highly nebulous yet highly influential concept of the condition feels to us at any given point. It can either be a break from an honourably busy life or short evidence that we are an unwanted, wretched, disgusting, and emotionally diseased being.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nThis is tricky but ultimately very hopeful, for it suggests that if only we could work on what being alone means to us, we could theoretically endure long periods alone. To build ourselves a new mental model of what being alone should truly mean, we might rehearse a few of the following arguments.\nDespite what an unfriendly voice inside our heads might tell us, we are the ones who can choose whether or not to be alone. Our solitude is willed rather than imposed. No one ever needs to be alone, so long as they dont mind who they are with. But we do mind; the wrong kind of company is a great deal lonelier for us than being by ourselves. That is, its further from what matters to us more grating, and its insincerity and more of a reminder of disconnection and misunderstanding than is the conversation we can have in the quiet of our minds.\nBeing alone is not proof that the world has rejected us. Its a sign that weve taken a good look at the available options and have, with wisdom, done some rejecting ourselves. Another big thought is that we need to appreciate how long it will take to find someone, given how choosy we are, for very good reasons. We arent just looking for anyone; the right candidate will be no less easy to find than a great job or a beautiful house. It might take many months, probably years. Expectations matter. If we regard a decade as a plausible timeframe, six months will skip. There is no better guarantee of a successful relationship than knowing that we could and can manage perfectly well on our own. It means that we will only look for someone who can deeply contribute to our life, not the societal pressure to conform to a certain relationship status can be overwhelming.\nIts as though being single is seen as a failure or something to be ashamed of. But in reality, being single can be a time of growth, reflection, and self-discovery. When we learn to appreciate our own company, we become more discerning about the people we choose to spend our time with. We become less likely to settle for someone who doesnt meet our standards or who doesnt treat us with the respect and care we deserve.\nBeing single doesnt mean being lonely. Loneliness can affect anyone, regardless of their relationship status. However, when we have a healthy relationship with ourselves, we are less likely to feel lonely even when we are physically alone. We learn to enjoy our company, pursue our interests and passions, and build a fulfilling life on our own terms.\n\nOf course, being single isnt always easy. It can be challenging to navigate the dating scene, to deal with rejection, or to come to terms with the fact that we might not find a partner right away. But with time and practice, we can learn to embrace the uncertainty and take joy in the journey of self-discovery. We can learn to appreciate the small moments of happiness and trust that the right person will come when the time is right.\nThe key to a successful relationship isnt just about finding the right person but about being the right person. By cultivating a healthy and satisfying relationship with us, we become more resilient, more discerning, and more capable of creating meaningful connections with others.\nSo if youre single, dont despair. Use this time to grow, to learn, and to love yourself. And when the time comes, youll be ready to welcome love into your life with open arms.\n\nThis is a good sign you likely read the full article.

      "body": "Leave a Comment\nThe other day I had a wonderful conversation with a friend. We were discussing  what is friendship? And what is love?\nBecause many people, particularly those who grew up in traumatic situations, may not be sure what love actually is, and what a friendship is.\nGenerational Trauma\nEven people who grow up in functional families experience some dysfunction or trauma. Its the nature of the beast  people are hurting, so they hurt others. This includes parents and other relatives.\nIts not that the parents dont love their children. But if they were abused as children, then they may not know any way to express their feelings that do not cause pain.\nFor example, some people associate love with possession. Others associate it with drama. These people might test their loved ones by doing something to see what kind of response they get.\nIf their partner responds respectfully, then the tester might feel disappointed because they associate love with actions that I consider emotionally abusive.\nIts not just partnerships\nThis kind of thing manifests itself in all types of relationships  we bring our emotional baggage with us to school, to work, to social groups, and to family reunions. This is why the holidays are often stressful. This is why so many people turn to alcohol or drugs.\nThere are emotional wounds that people struggle with and various substances are numbing agents. Or people try to cauterize their wounds, which can also be destructive.\nOne thing that I think is helpful  if you are someone who has gone through childhood trauma and you no longer know how love feels  stop focusing on the feelings. Focus on the actions.\nEvery time you are unsure if your partner loves you  ask yourself what their actions tell you. If you are unsure if you love them  look at how you act towards them.\nAre the actions consistent with love?\nWhat is love?\nI am on the autism spectrum, and sometimes I have had a hard time figuring out how to express and receive love. The following passage has helped me:\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nLove is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres: I Corinthians 13:47\nFor people who find the Bible triggering, there are other sources. Some non-religious people read works like the Bible, the Bhagavad Gita, etc., simply as philosophy or literature. But there are plenty of other resources such as the works of ancient Greek, Roman, Persian, Chinese, etc. thinkers.\nThe thing is  figuring out what love entails has been a question that people have pondered for ages and possible answers have been given. Why reinvent the wheel?\nWhen I ask myself if I love someone or if they love me  I examine their actions in the context of what the passage I cited says.\nRespect is Foundational\nThe other thing that has helped me  in any and all relationships, I consider respect to be the foundation. If we cannot mutually respect each other, then there is no point.\nThis holds true for any type of relationship  with pets, with friends, with employers and employees, with relatives, with ones partner, and even in a political sense.\nOne reason that many people are disgruntled with their government is the lack of perceived respect, in my opinion.\nOnce that foundation of respect is established, then one can proceed to deeper levels of connection if both parties want that.\nSpeaking of Greek philosophers\nI was originally going to delve into ancient Greek insights on love, but dont want this article to get too long. So I plan to get another article written later today or tomorrow exploring these concepts.\nI am fighting stage IV cancer. If you can",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nMommy, I want juice! Vincent demands. I turn from the stove to face him. I just got the milk you asked for. Drink that. I turn back to stir the rice. No. I. Want. Juice. He bobs his head as he annunciates each word. Then why did you ask for milk? I ask, defeated. I dont expect an answer, and I dont get one as I take another sippy cup from the cabinet and open the refrigerator. My juice! he says excitedly, as though we had been searching for it for hours.\nI pour juice into his cup, but he insists on putting on the top himself, which results in juice spilling onto the kitchen island and his shirt, but at least it doesnt make its way onto the floor. With the top securely fastened, he takes several big sips. Thank you, mommy, he says as he puts the cup down and goes back to eating his graham crackers. Youre welcome, honey bun.\nThe timer goes off. Is that for the pasta or the squash? Im cooking two different meals at once because its my only free evening this week, and Josh wont be home for another month. I was hoping to have more prepared before picking up Vincent from daycare. I take out the squash thats been in the microwave and poke it with a fork. Still firm. I put it back into the microwave and add another three minutes.\nMommy, wanna play with me? Vincent asks, his hazel eyes round with anticipation as he hops off his stool. In a minute, honey. I have to finish dinner. You have to finish dinner? he repeats.\nMy phone dings  its a text message from my mother. It dings again. And again. Now Im in a group chat about the coffee table she stenciled. On the stovetop, water starts to boil. I pour the pasta into the water and turn down the burner. Vincent finds a firetruck and a tow truck and begins racing them around his tracks on the floor. I stir the rice. Ding!\nMommy, I still hungry. That distraction didnt last long, I think. The pasta is almost ready, honey. Then you can have some pasta with pesto. This gets his attention. There arent many things Vincent loves more than pesto. Pesto! he shouts, wiping a hand through his hair. Graham cracker crumbs fall from his blonde curls, reminding me we still have to do bath time.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nDing! My aunt raves about my mothers stencil work. Ding! My cousin agrees  it looks professional. The timer goes off again. Mommy, I want pesto! Ok, honey. Just give me a minute. I want pesto. I want pesto. Ding. Ding. Ding.\n\nI pull the lasagna pan with the squash in it out of the microwave, but I move too quickly. The water from the bottom of the pan splashes onto my leg and all over the floor.\nThe pain is excruciating. Ouch! Jesus! Oh my God! Vincent looks at me, horrified. Ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch. I grab the dish towel off the oven handle to dry off my leg and the floor. Then, I open the freezer to find an ice pack. Vincent looks like hes about to cry. What happened mommy? You got a boo-boo? I hold back my own tears. Motherfucker, it hurts. Why is Josh never here when I need him? I cant do this on my own.\nIts okay, honey. Mommy burned herself, but its okay. It just hurts. Mommy bourned herself? Vincents over-annunciation makes me smile for a second. Yes, but Im going to be okay. I go to the linen closet to get a towel so I can tie the ice pack around my leg.\nWhy dont you get your truck puzzle? I suggest. Truck puzzle? Vincent repeats before waddling toward his room. This should give me at least five minutes. With the ice pack securely in place, I bring the lasagna pan over to the sink and carefully dump out the water. I stuff the squash with the rice, bean, and onion mixture Ive already prepared and place it in the oven. The pasta is finally done. I pour it into a colander and take out a bowl from the cabinet just as Vincent comes back into the kitchen.\nAre you ready for your pasta with pesto? I ask. Yay! Vincent does a little hop before climbing onto his stool. Ding! Ding! Ding! I switch my phone to silent and sit on the stool next to him, too exhausted to eat.\nFour more weeks.",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nThe distant, independent, mysterious, aloof, slightly cold, but charming emotionally unavailable types can be so dang alluring. I know firsthand.\nThey are like a drug you want to get more and more of, even if you wished they were more emotionally available to you. But thats how you should approach ending your desire to want an emotionally available person. Its an active drug-like withdrawal you need to take. Because you deserve to be with someone who wants all of youbut first, you need to believe that.\nWhats going on with emotionally unavailable people?\nAn emotionally unavailable person is typically seen as someone who has a fear or block to sharing their emotions, and feelings, and just generally struggles to sustain the emotional bond between the relationship. They delay making plans, dont really want a label to the relationship, cant commit, are inconsistent, they lead you on (aka \navoidant\n attachment style, where they avoid intimacy due to past traumatic experiences of emotional neglect and shame for their feelings. They have not healed these wounds yet, and see relationships as a trap where it would be better to keep people at arms distance. They are afraid of intimacy.\nOr the other hand, an emotionally unavailable person could just be someone you, specifically, cant have. They are emotionally unavailable to you, although they could be emotionally available to others. An example is someone in a monogamous romantic relationship already or even someone who is busy (with a new job at work, with kids, with other recent big commitments) and clearly states this from the beginning.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nTheres a lot of societal stereotyping around emotionally unavailable people being men, but emotionally unavailable romantic partners exist across the entire gender spectrum.\nNow I could sit here and do a psycho-analysis of emotionally unavailable people but that wouldnt give us true healing. Because healing our desire to want emotionally unavailable people comes from looking in.\nNow, whats going on with us?\nWell, emotionally unavailable people like emotionally unavailable people. Now I hope this wasnt too crazy of an insightful sentence, but its an important one to realize. Healthy people arent interested in continuing to date toxic people, and toxic people arent interested in continuing to date healthy people. You attract who you are, especially in the relationship with yourself. If you are emotionally unavailable to yourself, you will prefer an emotionally unavailable person because they feel familiar with how you treat yourself.\nThis is the science of attraction. Our mind is wired to choose what feels familiar because familiarity breeds safety and our mind wants to keep us safe. Specifically, our subconscious mind, which is responsible for ~95% of our decision-making. You want to change who you are attracted to, you need to change what feels familiar. And that starts from within. From looking at the person reading this and making a chance to be more emotionally available to yourself.\nIts really important to realize that always being attracted to emotionally unavailable people is a subconscious manifestation of your own emotional unavailability and fears around commitment, because if you were truly emotionally available and ready for love, you would be turned off by men who arent, not continue to chase or obsess over them. \nErika Simone\nEvery person youre romantically interested in is a mirror and piece of feedback about how we treat ourselves. We have to believe we deserve better, and we have to believe we truly deserve emotionally available love even if our past told us we didnt.\nLuckily, we dont have to be held back by our past anymoreand it starts with showing ourselves that.\nSo how can we become more emotionally available?\nThere are many ways to become more emotionally available, and you can find the way(s) that works best for you, but a starting list includes regularly integrating:\nJournaling about how you feel\nMeditating to connect with yourself\nSpending time being physically intimate and present with yourself\nDoing activities that you discover you love\nGoing on\nCreating moments of vulnerability by allowing yourself to cry\nWrite a letter to your younger self (especially explaining why you deserve love then and now)\nAsking others for help when needed\nCreate, vocalize, and enforce your boundaries\nSharing how you feel with safe people (people who care about you)\nIntentionally surround yourself with emotionally available couples/people\n\nChanging your habits can take a lot of work and a lot of time, but you have to realize the pain of liking an emotionally unavailable person is worse than the pain of spending your whole life blocking yourself from real, healthy, and genuine love that you inherently deserve.\nYou change the world when you change yourself. World healing starts with self-healing. You end the curse of liking emotionally unavailable people when you realize the beauty of becoming more emotionally available to yourself, and you act on that realization.\nYou deserve to heal your limiting beliefs. Its now time to believe that.\n",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nAfter writing Mens Guide To Relationships, I proceedeth to also pen one for ladies. But since I am a man, I refrained from doing so as itll be probably controversial.\nTherefore, I sought out a writer friend of mine, to share her thoughts. She penned the following as her advice to ladies in or entering a relationship. Especially for the first time.\n\nBy Benedicta Chiwendu.\nWhenever the subject of relationships is brought up, I always choose to tread with caution seeing that it is a subject that gives itself to delicate interest.\nA major barrier to strong lasting harmonious relationships is the fact that people are different. These differences make it hard for deeper connections. We also have to deal with changes that happen within and around people at different levels of transition.\nSo in this article, what I aim to achieve is to give you something that will light up your understanding of this matter.\nMen complain about women being difficult to understand, and women complain about the complexity of masculinity in men.\nOn one hand, women tend to see beyond the present moment into the future and when they try to talk about it, a man sees it as fantasy. And will attempt to shake her out into a more realistic frame of mind.\nIn turn, she perceives him as not being so much into her, and issues begin to arise.\nThe Dos and Donts of a woman entering a relationship or already in a relationship are simple:\nDo not come into a relationship with high expectations.\nNow, dont misunderstand me I am not saying you shouldnt have expectations in your relationships but they must not be unrealistically high.\nAnything you expect should be tied to your own capacity to deliver and not the other persons because you can only trust yourself to get what you want.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nMost ladies enter into a relationship expecting the man to be their go-to person for everything. When she wants to talk, when she hits a rock, her chef, her driver, her sister, her father, etc. This is because we love differently. A woman loves and goes all out for her man. But a man tends to hold himself back until he feels safe enough.\nSo youre wondering why isnt he doing this or doing that. But heres the thing, while entering into a relationship with a man you should know that even though this man has professed love to you, hes still not secure. Even though he tells you all the sweet things and you are really into him, hes still having doubts and second-guessing himself.\nWhat you should focus on in the beginning stages of your relationship is not the grand gestures and high romance. You might not get it. Instead, focus on trying to let him know that you got his back and hell never need you and not find you.\nTry to dispel the fears and bring him out of doubt.\nIn summary, let him know he can trust you.\nOnce a man trusts you, hell never want to leave you.\nBe bold to be who you are.\nAs women, we always feel the need to please our partners. Sometimes this could mean not eating meat because he told you hes vegan even though you love meat.\nIm not trying to ignore the place of sacrifice in love but the issue here would be reciprocity.\nBe simple.\nDont come in trying to please.\nGive him a chance to really get to know the real person so that hell appreciate the efforts youd make in pleasing him and that way he could see them as sacrifices on your part.\nA woman must have some regard for her reputation.\nDont hear what he did not say.\nThis is tricky.\nSometimes women tend to give interpretations to a mans words and actions. You might have heard a girl say I thought you love me.\nThat is it, you thought! That was your thought, not his.\nSo do not hear more than he is saying as men tend to say what they mean and mean what they say. Take his words literally. The negative effect of giving your interpretation to words is that he might say call me if you need anything, but dont translate it to call me every second, every minute, and anyhow.\nGive the relationship time to grow at its own pace.\nDont misunderstand me, there is you, there is him and there is a relationship. Treat these three things as if they have a life of their own.\nThe relationship is not you, neither is the relationship, him. So treat the relationship as a third person. Do not impose your choices on it. Dont make it your show. And do not box it with your experience and expectations.\nJust let it grow at its own pace.\nSome relationship needs months before the two involved can be madly into each other. Some relationships need a year or more before sex can be great between the two involved. Its advisable, therefore, to let the relationship grow naturally while playing your role.\nIn fact, treat it as a child. Understanding that time and patience are needed for growth.\nAnd finally, understand that mistakes can be made. Thats fine. Because correction can also be made.\n\nIf you read to this point, thank you for reading.\nCheck out this must-read,",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nThe experience of nature being magical, being enchanted, being mesmerising that each child has, tends to fade when we reach adolescence.\nI recently had a devastating conversation with my 15-year-old son about flowers. We were on a ridge walk north of Ubud and I was in awe over all the amazing and beautifully different wildflowers; their colours, their scents, their shapes. I shared my enthusiasm with him, and his response was: I dont see anything special, mum, a flower is a flower.\nWhile it might seem fine and normal that our view on nature alters when we grow up, and that we no longer swoon over the color of a flower or the glittery wings of an insect or the scent of newly fallen rain, it is of great importance that we understand the actual loss that happens when this kind of behavior gets cultivated out of us and we start viewing nature mainly through a rational perspective that focuses on how annoying and messy it is when it isnt tamed and controlled. This loss doesnt only concern our ability to see, salute and embrace beauty; diverse, messy, chaotic beauty (a loss, which in itself is bad enough): I am convinced that this loss is also to a great extent the reason why we dont take care of our natural environment.\nIn this equation however, we forget that we too are nature; we are not separated from nature, not in control of nature, not in a position to view nature as ours to use and abuse. It seems that the enthralled experience of nature is crucial to sustainable behavior.\nBut if the experience of the enchanted nature is crucial to fostering respect for nature and developing sustainable lifestyles, then why isnt nurturing the ability to experience nature in that way a part of schooling  or at least of environmentally focused education? And  what does it take to support the experience of the enchanted cosmos in children, to maintain it in adolescent  and to reintroduce and foster it in adulthood (as a part of rewilding the late modern human being)?\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nIs enchantment inter-depended on wildness and a degree of hardship? Is convenience and cultivation the enemy of the magic of the beautiful, chaotic diverse life?\nRewilding would involve a step back to a less convenient nature-relationship: a relationship in which a manifold of annoying insects sums around our ears at spring, in which bushes and weeds grow wild, and animals might pose a threat. But at the same time; that rewilding, that step back to less convenience, less user-friendly-ness and more friction, chaos, challenges and even danger might be prerequisite for the re-enchantment of nature.\nAnd that re-enchantment is so needed. Because it has the potential to foster a deep sense of interconnectivity and respect as well as to fill us up through nourishing aesthetic experiences. The mysterious, unpredictable, uncultivated part of nature is crucial to sustain in order to re-enchant it and foster the immediate, uncultivated respect for it that each child owns and lives by, before s/he is shaped by our everything-is-there-for-us-to-exploit-culture.\n",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nI admit it, I am a procrastinator, and I tick all of the boxes for being a procrastinator. I have hated it previously, but now I know the signs and use them to kick-start me into action.\n\nYou are a procrastinator, theres almost no doubt in my mind.\nI also believe you are a high achiever or at least someone who wants to be achieving more than they are.\nIf you werent a procrastinator I doubt you would be reading this as you are probably trying to distract yourself from doing something meaningful, by the end of this article I would have opened your eyes to the forms of distraction and procrastination, and what to do about it.\n\nAfter finally admitting it, I could look back at how debilitating procrastination was, and why I never got anything done, no matter how much I was shouted at or how much time I had.\nOr there were many times I would either not start on something because I couldnt figure out where to begin or I was too scared in case I failed or even too lazy and I would distract myself with gaming or porn (this was back in the day, I havent watched porn for well over a year, and I advise you do the same.)\n\nThe reason we procrastinate\nLet us address and figure out the reason why you are procrastinating. The main reason we procrastinate is self-doubt or low self-worth.\nI used to procrastinate before making phone calls because I felt I sounded like an idiot, I hated my voice and I used to mumble and the other person on the phone had to repeatedly ask me again what I just said.\nThis is uncomfortable. Of course, I wanted to avoid it.\nI even procrastinate by editing parts of articles Ive written to avoid having to write more for the exact same article. Sound familiar?\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nThis is the same for many pursuits in life, the obvious one being fitness.\nnot one person I know is genuinely happy with their body but so few are doing anything about it, so much easier to sit on the sofa and have a bar of chocolate to get that dopamine hit, than get hot and sweaty and ache after.\nA version of what William James, the American philosopher, mentions is that action and feeling go together; we can control the action and then in due course, the feelings will follow. Doing that which we know is uncomfortable at the time, but in turn, makes us feel satisfied and happier is the way to go.\nShort-term pain for longer-term gain.\nThe Four types of procrastinating. which one are you?\nThe proudly lazy but internally unhappy\nThe not-so-busy bee\nI perform at my best under pressure.\n\nUsing laziness as an excuse to procrastinate\nBeing lazy and reaffirming you are lazy by telling everyone you are lazy is highly self-deprecating.\nIt is also highly unattractive and you wonder why you havent found Mr or Mrs right yet, and/or you are wondering why your partner resents you when they are at work all day or trying to achieve things in their life and you are moaning about being lazy.\nIt is a negative feedback loop that needs to be addressed. When your motivation is low and you dont have much energy, you need to take action to address this.\nThe feeling of being unenergised wont go away, you need to find something that energises you.\nUsually eating the right food will help this, not snacking and eating less unhealthy food, drinking plenty of water etc. but youve heard all this before right? When you were feeling low about something else.\nFinding something that energises you is the key, mine is gardening, meditating, writing and helping other people. If I dont do these few things I run out of energy and feel less motivated to bother even trying to help myself. You have to ensure you find what refills that tank of yours. Be kind to yourself.\n\nNot so Busy Bees\nI am pretty hot on questioning how busy people are when they say they are busy, especially when they are moaning about it.\nI can guarantee no one is as busy as previous generations when they had to work all hours to get food on plates. When they were growing a lot of their food or raising and slaughtering their own animals for meat.\nThe idea of stopping to check Insta every 5 mins to see if they had some random person, they shouldnt dont care about, like a picture they put up about their dog, is laughable.\nDont use being too busy as an excuse, hold your tongue and find time to achieve what you want to. Fight the algorithms that are trying to distract you, understand when they have diverted your attention away and get back to achieving your dreams.\n\nShiny Object Syndrome\nThis is a term that hits the nail on the head when you feel like you have achieved something without fully achieving it and then moving on to the next thing is a part of this so-called syndrome, another part is you are chasing something new and exciting and once the fad passes it is onto the next thing shiny new thing.\nThis can be broken down into smaller parts too. For example, you are decorating your house, you get started in the bedrooms.\nYou cut in and edge around all the sockets and corners, and you get a couple of coats of white on, amazing, and looks 10x better. what about the skirting?\nno one likes glossing, do they?\nBut you really want the other rooms done so whoever sees it will be impressed by how much you have got done so quickly, you rush to open the other pot of paint, an electric blue, awesome, the guests will love this for their feature wall.\nYou get painting and realise you should have stayed with the white one from the first room, too late now, this goes on and on until you have done an average job of the whole house rather than monotasking and getting a perfect finish on the whole house, it would have just taken a bit longer.\nI was very good at this form of procrastinating, and I would sit down at the end of it unfulfilled because I hadnt actually completed any task to a good standard, just started lots of them.\nThis syndrome is a form of procrastination and distraction, by stopping yourself and taking a breather. Think about what you want to achieve you will get more done. You feel as though you are busy and proactive but you arent.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nYou end up being a busy fool.\nA trick I use now when I have a lot to achieve but only a day to do it in is to write down a list of what needs doing and tick it off one by one. I can safely say that when I do this, I have done all my tasks by midday and am happy and satisfied, and then the rest of the day is mine, its all a bonus, extra time. Imagine that.\n\nThe time-pressure hero\nI touched on this one before, waiting until the deadline to get everything done.\nThe classic I used to do when I was a serial procrastinator and I had just started going out with my then girlfriend, now wife. Was waiting until she had messaged to say she was on her way home for me to tidy up the dishes from breakfast.\nI was a lot younger back then and didnt have many responsibilities so I, kind of, forgive myself.

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nI grew up in a family where it wasnt very normal to say I love you to one another. The closest wed get would be saying lots of love when we signed off on the phone or on birthday cards. I guess it sort of gives the same message, but somehow feels easier to say.\nThe first time I said I love you to another human being was when I was twenty-six years old. It wasnt the first long term relationship that Id been in, but it was the first one where Id actually felt genuine love.\nIn the weeks leading up to the first time that I said the big ILY, I had wanted to say it many times before. Id even tried it out a few times, whispering it into my boyfriends hair and his chest as I lay my head on it.\nI was the first one to say it out loud.\nWe were out at a festival, inside the music tent and some song started playing that had the words ILY in it. When the song finished, I looked right at him and said it. His face went from shocked to happy, and I felt incredibly relieved when he said it back to me.\nI look back on that evening as one of the most special ones in my life. Even though we went on to say ILY many more times to each other, it was that first time that stays imprinted in my mind.\nWe eventually broke up  although not for a lack of love  and are both with other people now.\nMy current boyfriend said ILY to me first, and it is the most special day of my life (it happened to be my 30th birthday too).\nMy boyfriend and I arent the sort of people to say ILY everyday. We dont sign off every phone call, every text or every goodbye with those words. Maybe we dont say it enough.\nHowever, when we do say it, we know that it isnt just out of habit or out of routine, but because we deeply feel it and want to express it. When I hear my boyfriend say those words to me, I fully believe them. I feel honoured by them.\nThere have been other times when people have said ILY to me and it has just been oddly weird.\nSomeone who Id only known for about a year, and not very well at that, once said it to me as we were saying goodbye at a bar.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nShe didnt say ILY, but LY, which does seem more casual, but still, it almost stopped me in my tracks.\nI kind of wanted to ask her  do you really love me?\nGoogle defines love as: an intense feeling of deep affection. Did she really feel an intense, deep affection for me rather than just a casual liking?\nI have another friend who says ILY to pretty much everybody pretty much all of the time. Each time I hear it being said  whether it be to me or to someone else, I have a sense of the phrase being cheapened.\nLike most things that we have too much of, it doesnt feel special anymore.\nWith this particular friend, its a throwaway comment, equivalent to goodbye or see you later. I dont believe that he truly loves everyone that he says it too, even if he is a generally loving person.\nSo what happens when he really loves someone?\nWhat will he say to differentiate between the ILY he says to almost everybody he meets and the ILY of his actual loved one?\nAt least in Spanish there are two ways of saying it  te amo and te quiero with te amo being considered to be more powerful and representative of a deeper, more profound sensation.\nBut in English, we dont have that option.\nI think its possible to show some one that you love them in more ways than just words. My boyfriend shows me everyday in the little things that he does for me, so I dont need to hear those words so often.\nSo, to sign off, Im going to say: I dont love you. Youre alright though.\n",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nFood and music are separate from sex, but both long been used to express desire. Aside from making love in a bathtub surrounded by candles, I cant think of anything much more sensual than a gourmet meal or a heartfelt tune. But which one wins?\nI know probably no one asked this question, but Im going to answer it anyway. (It turns out quite a few researchers have also looked into this topic.)\nSo warm up that ramen, put on your favourite playlist, and pull up your chair  because were digging in\nWhen food met romance\nObviously, humans have been eating food since its existence to stay alive. At the very basic level, food is necessary to keep us alive  even if its not tasty.\nOur ancestors presumable ate raw meat up until 2 million years ago, when cooking came into the picture. Before that, the ancient hominoid would stuff raw meat into their face like a toddler at a spaghetti factory. Theres nothing sexy about that.\nIts not until our brains expanded that we really started to experiment with food. Interestingly, our brains didnt get bigger until we invented cooking. The theory is that our jaws got smaller (because we didnt need to rip through raw meat), which allowed more space for our modern brains to develop.\nHowever, turning cooking into an art form is relatively new. Its hard to say when it started, but theres evidence of cooking pits (earth ovens) from about 30,000 years ago. This suggests humans figured out how to make meat more tender by slow-roasting it. About 12,000 years ago, our ancestors discovered new seeds that could be grown into yummy vegetables as a side to their cooked meat.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nThis still didnt necessarily make food sexy.\nCulinary art did that.\nIf you look at popular social media accounts that focus on gourmet food (also known as food porn), youll see there are a variety of spices, sauces, and beverage pairings designed to enhance the eating experience. Presentation has also become an important element of dining  people pay big bucks for fancy garnish and stylish arrangements.\nDont tell me you havent been turned on by a commercial that shows gravy being poured on beef in slow motion, silky chocolate swirling around, or something else to that effect. Every fiber of your being wants to crawl into the screen and devour it.\nFood has become more than just an essential part of life. It has become an intimate experience. You can savour a well-crafted meal that starts with foreplay (soup/salad), followed by intercourse (the main course), and then dessert (the warm cuddling afterwards.) Except instead of a nap, you drink coffee at the end.\nThe point is you go to a restaurant to be impressed. You want the sizzling, seasoned beef, the brown sugar glazed baby carrots, and the complex sauces that bring out all the flavours. (Mind you, sometimes you just want a fast-food cheeseburger  think of those like a quicky. Sometimes you just need to scratch the itch, so to speak.)\nYou also dont want to rush a nice meal  you want to take it slow, ooh-ing and ahh-ing over each delicious mouthful. Sound familiar?\nAccording to science, no food has ever been scientifically proven to be an aphrodisiac. But when I bite into a delicious meal, I would wager the reaction inside me is similar to having sex. (Ive never had a food-induced orgasm or have I?)\nMusic that stirs the loins\nIn the other corner, we have music, which has been a form of human expression for about 40,000 years  not far from the time we started getting more serious about preparing our food (coincidence?)\nAt the start, ancient music was likely used mainly as a vessel for dancing and rituals. Well, it still is  I mean, people love to dance, and music is part of modern religious ceremonies. However, music has also become a cornerstone of the mating ritual.\nWhile music was not inherently sexual in centuries past, the sexual intent of the newer tunes is quite obvious when you listen to the lyrics. If you make a playlist of these songs for someone, its hard not to know whats going on in your head. You want into their pants.\nIn my day, when we had a romantic (read: sexual) interest in someone, we just made him or her a mix tape. It was not only about predicting their musical tastes  it also showed that you were making an effort to woo them. Im not sure if a mix tape ever actually led to sex, but that was the idea.\nMusic strikes a sexual chord inside of us that we cant explain, even if the content isnt sexual. It makes us move around rhythmically, and it lights up our brains with pleasant chemicals. Its no wonder people put on sensual music when their love interest comes over.\nMusic is like a mating call in disguise. Whether youre singing or listening, youre making an intimate connection with someone, massaging their brains and bodies from the inside.\nWhy do you think so many people go nuts at concerts? Its not necessarily the musician, but the sweet elixir of beats, energy, and eye candy drives people wild.\nIve also never had a music-induced orgasm, but there may have been music playing at the time.\nSo, which one is sexier  food or music?\nWeve talked about why both food and music are sensual, and now we can attempt to determine a winner based on our findings.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nHeres a recap of their biggest advantages, with a few additional points:\nFood:\n Is made with love (possibly while making love)\n The flavours can release happy chemicals\n Food can be physically applied to a lover (and eaten off them)\n Eating employs several senses: from taste to smell to texture\n It can have a beginning, middle, and end\n It is often hot\n You can arrange it on a plate to blow your partners mind\n It keeps your body alive\nMusic:\n It makes you move your pelvis in unapologetic ways\n It makes you sweat in a room full of other sweaty people\n You may have a huge crush on the musician/band (visual element)\n Music videos can be pretty sexy too\n You can have as much of it as you want\n You can arrange it on a playlist to blow your partners mind\n It keeps your soul alive\nWith all of these valid points taken into consideration, Im happy to announce that the winner of the food vs. music sexiness contest is\n[drum roll]\nAh, heck. I cant pick a winner. Im going to need you people to weigh in on this topic. Which ones wins? Is either of them better than sex in your experience? Let me know!\n",

I thought Id get a bit vulnerable and share a story in an effort to embrace resiliency.\nThe kind of love Ive been seeking is the kind that I hope will eventually mature into what I call Stirring the Oatmeal Love. Thats when, after the frenetic energy of new love has worn away and Ive been with my love long enough to grow old (or in my case, older) it might look something like this: Im standing at the stove in my ratty, old bathrobe stirring the morning oatmeal and my sweetie looks at me from over the Sunday newspaper and says, Damn baby, you still make me hot to which I reply in my best Marilyn Monroe sultry, breathy voice, Im feeling kinda hot right now. He would then look at me and chuckle as he pointed out the reason why I was feeling hot was because one of my boobs had sagged into the pot of oatmeal thus explaining the heat I was feeling.\nBut I digress thats future love this is now.\nI think the word love is incredibly misunderstood. Is it a feeling? A noun? Is it a verb? Whats the difference between love and lust? Is there a difference? These are just a few of the thoughts that run through my mind when I contemplate the word love and my pursuit of it.\nI believe love is a choice one makes daily. Its an action verb that requires action. Believing this and doing it are two different things. Choosing to love someone scared the shit out of me. It was intimidating to choose to fall in love and then hope the recipient felt something akin to it in return. Someone once said, Expectation is the root of all heartache and they are absolutely right. In order for me to experience true love I had to gift my own freely and let go of any expectation of its reciprocation.\nOne day, I met a guy who was cool, and charismatic. I liked him. He made me laugh and he loved adventure. He had warm brown eyes that smiled, access to his silly, inner child, and loved his dog better than any other dog owner I had ever met  which counts for a lot in my book. I believe our ability to love our furry family members so completely is the purest form of unconditional love.\nMy new love interest and I had plenty in common. We both had the same taste in multiple areas, DJ Universe was playing all the right songs, we shared this cool uni-mind where we both had many of the same thoughts at the same time, and we also enjoyed fantastic chemistry.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nCould he be the one?!\nI wanted to experience deep love and connection. I really did. I knew this meant a leap of faith into the unknown. I was fearlessly terrified. Fearless because a part of me was willing to dive in headfirst and terrified because another part wanted to run away screaming with my arms flailing wildly in the air.\nThe choice to love deeply, completely, and intimately would call for me to draw upon my courage while I faced the inevitable suffering that will ultimately occur when any of my relationships end, as they all will, whether it be in one month, five years, two decades, or at the end of my life. Knowing this, I decided to give our budding romance a go.\nWhen we first started dating we would engage in this strange dance. It was actually more of an aquatic ballet or synchronized swimming if you will. It kind of looked like this  swim together briefly, connect heart to heart, suddenly realize we were happy and in sync, and then splash awkwardly backward in alarm. The dive away from each other could take the form of disappearing into our cell phones, escalating conflicts, numbing ourselves with T.V., or an infinite variety of other ways to avoid the fear we felt upon having exposed a tiny portion of our tender hearts to each other.\nWe were both waiting to see who was going to be first to abandon this new, liquid dance that could become love if we let it. Who was going to quit the pool take their flippers and sequined swim cap and get out of the water? We could stay in and keep ourselves safe by hiding in the shallows with the occasional dive into the deep end  that shadowy area of emotional intimacy and surrender. We could also choose to stay in and learn to navigate the murky depths of this new pool of love.\nIt all came down to choice.\nI knew that choosing to fall in love with this man was going to require that I draw upon my bravery in a big way in order to handle the possibility of heartbreak. Yielding to loving him was going to test my capacity for dealing with a lot of discomforts as I bared my soul and shared who I was.\nRemember, I had no idea if he would love me back, and if he did, what that might look like or even if it would be right for me. I only knew we had a lot in common coupled with an intense, mutual, physical attraction.\nThe task of attempting to co-create a strong foundation with him while dealing with a constant stream of triggers and internal stories was daunting. I didnt know about him but the shame stories I carried were deeply ingrained and tough to uproot and certainly not his responsibility. It was personal stuff Id been working on and hopefully, I had done enough to get it right this time.\nI also wondered early on if we would be able to transcend our dysfunctional histories and create new, healthy stories together. Would we be able to find enough shared realities to make a go of it? Or would he hear my reality and turn away in rejection or worse yet, judgment?!\nI mean, what if, once the rose-colored glasses came off, he looked at me and realized I wasnt the angel he thought I was? For example, I wake up grumpy and irritable if I dont get enough sleep. If Im cranky enough I may snap at him, thus shattering forever the illusion of domestic bliss. What if the meal I cooked didnt have enough salt, or even worse, what if he found out I only like to cook if I have someone to keep me company in the kitchen!!? I needed to stay centered and in alignment with my own self-worth and believe he could handle me at my worst.\nGranting him such intimate access to my internal landscape would allow him to see the real me with all the lights turned on. I hoped like hell he would find my inner beauty more attractive than my many flaws. After all, he could easily weaponize the tender secrets I would reveal. My heart would be his to crush because when I decide to love, I go all in. For me, its the only way I know how and the rewards can be exceptional. Im a huge believer that the heights of love and passion are only equal to the depths of sorrow and loss one is willing to risk. My bandwidth was huge the heights to which I ascend is a rarified atmosphere so the possibility of its opposite in pain was great.\nI wanted to dare to choose love and be courageous. I wanted to challenge myself to drop my defenses with this man who was still, in many ways, a virtual stranger. If I focused on the failures that littered my ",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nDont take anything personally. Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you wont be the victim of needless suffering.\nDon Miguel Ruiz\nThere are many horrors inflicted by one human being upon another. Then to hear acts of violence or cruelty as people behaving like animals really bothers me because it insults creatures that never kill just because they can. Animals do it for survival or because they feel threatened. They dont plot and scheme and conspire to commit murder or to hire others to do their dirty work.\nAnd they dont violate trust for their own selfish pleasures, robbing children of their innocence and making the world a terrifying place of abuse.\nOver the years in my work as a counsellor, then a homeopath and a psychic/medium, and in my personal life, too, Ive been shocked to learn just how many people have been sexually violated as children. What has been more shocking is that in many cases, they dont even realise it  as in my own case. As children, we think our environments are normal. Were hard-wired to trust our parents; it is our survival instinct at its strongest. Therefore, we dont recognise abuse for what it is.\nIll never forget the day the A word was dropped right smack in the center of my life. The day a psychologist listened to the reasons for my ending a marriage, then listened to some details about my background, and promptly  but ever so gently  asked if I knew I had been abused. Not just in that marriage, but going back to my earliest years.\nI felt as though my life, everything I knew, everything I believed, everything I trusted had been blown apart and was lying in a million little puzzle pieces on the floor. I knew Id have to put them together again but in a way that created a whole new picture. The problem was that I had no idea what that picture was supposed to look like.\nAnd I was sure that with so much damage to my soul, many of those pieces would be missing anyway, leaving me with gaping holes that could never heal.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nBut I was wrong. Thank heaven I was wrong.\nI thought I would feel like a victim forever. But that was before I learned why I felt that way in the first place.\nAbuse, whether physical, emotional and/or sexual, makes children feel worthless. They feel dirty, disgusting, inherently flawed and bad. In their egocentricity, they believe they deserve every rotten thing that happens to them. In their trusting little hearts, they cannot differentiate between the abhorrent behaviour of adults and their own value and perfection as spiritual beings.\nChances are that they will carry these beliefs into adulthood and will continue to find relationships that are unhealthy. Theyll hook up with partners who demean them, are controlling, abusive or toxic in some way because in the deepest parts of their souls, they believe this is all they deserve.\nIt is only when they understand that they did not deserve the abuse they endured as children, and that it was not their fault, that they begin to take back their power. When they can begin to heal the damage to their self-esteem, self-image, and self-worth, and understand that the perpetrators of the abuse were at fault, they feel an emerging sense of strength and value.\nImagine that youre wearing some yummy new clothes that you love. You think you look great. You feel fab in your new threads, confident and seriously hot.\nYou see a complete stranger who says, I wouldnt be caught dead wearing that. It doesnt look good on you at all.\nYou might become angry or indignant. Who the heck is this moron? Who asked for his opinion? And who gives a rats @$$ what he thinks anyway?\nBut then your partner sees you and says, Oh, I dont think that outfit suits you at all. I dont like it. Youre crushed. You wanted him to think you look splendiferous. You might contemplate taking your new clothes back to the shop. Your confidence is shattered. You think you look like a weenie and you dont want anyone else to see you looking like this.\nIt is human nature to want to please the people we love. This is why we take their actions and opinions to heart. And this is how we end up feeling like we deserve to be abused. Theres something wrong with me. If only I hadnt done this or that. I must be a very disgusting person if they did this disgusting thing to me. I deserved it; I should have known better.\nThat kind of thinking leaves a person feeling like a victim. Come on, do it to me again; I deserve it. And so that person keeps finding people who will validate the belief, Im a victim. I am trapped, helpless, powerless.\nWe take back our power when we understand that what other people do to us is not about us. Their choices are their own. And if theyve chosen to be abusive, they are the only ones responsible for it.\nWe enter this world as pure and perfect spirits in little human bodies. We do not deserve abuse of any kind by anyone at any time. And therefore, we are not victims unless we choose to think of ourselves that way.\nThere are some people who prefer to live like that, people who have been told the abuse was not their fault, people who have heard that there is hope and help, and that they dont have to feel like that any more. They could choose to step into a position of power. But they prefer their victimhood. It allows them to stay stuck, to get attention, to get sympathy, to be dependent, or to wait to be rescued and not take responsibility for their own lives, their own healing, and their own happiness.\nBut for those of us who want to be happy, to move forward in life and to find peace and healing, we reject holding onto the sins that have been committed against our perfect souls, because to do anything else is to perpetuate them ourselves. We seek wellness, find our strength, stand up for ourselves and refuse to allow any further attacks on our vulnerability, which is so precious, so beautiful and so perfect.\nThere is hope. And I can promise you, there is healing. You just have to want it. And you dont ever have to feel like a victim again.\n\nThis post was previously published on Liberty Forrests blog.\n***",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nLet us provide an overview of the principles of playground design in Australia in this short write-up. The design of playgrounds in Australia is guided by a set of principles that aim to ensure that playgrounds are safe, inclusive, and promote childrens development and play.\nThe following are a few principles that are generally followed for\nin Australia.\n1. Safety\n: The safety of children is the top priority when designing a playground. The design of playgrounds should be based on current safety standards and guidelines. Playground equipment should be regularly inspected and maintained to ensure it remains safe for use.\n2. Inclusivity\n: Playground design should be inclusive, ensuring that all children, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can access and enjoy the play space.\nThis includes providing features such as wheelchair access, sensory play opportunities, and equipment that can be used by children with physical or cognitive impairments.\n3. Accessibility\n: Playgrounds should be designed in such a way that it is easily accessible for all children, including those with mobility impairments. This means designing pathways and surfaces that are easy to navigate with a wheelchair or mobility device.\n4. Age appropriateness\n: Playgrounds should be designed with consideration for the age range of the children who will be using the space.\nThis may involve providing equipment that is appropriate for different age groups, as well as designing play spaces that are challenging and engaging for children of different ages.\n5. Natural elements\n: Playground design should incorporate natural elements, such as plants, trees, and rocks, to create an engaging and stimulating play environment.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nNatural elements can provide opportunities for sensory exploration and imaginative play.\n6. Creative play\n: Playground design should encourage creative and imaginative play. This may involve providing opportunities for children to engage in imaginative play, such as creating their own stories and scenarios.\n7. Risk-taking\n: Playground design should provide opportunities for children to take risks and challenge themselves. This may involve providing equipment that is challenging and requires physical effort, such as climbing structures and balance beams.\n8. Play value\n: Playground design should be based on the concept of play value, which is the measure of how engaging and fun a play space is for children. Play value can be enhanced by providing a variety of play opportunities, including active play, social play, and imaginative play.\n9. Durability\n: Playground equipment and design should be durable and able to withstand the wear and tear of regular use. This includes choosing materials that are weather-resistant and easy to maintain.\nAdditionally, playground designers in Australia are encouraged to consider the cultural context of the community in which the playground is located, as well as the environmental impact of the design. These principles help to ensure that playgrounds are not only safe and fun but also culturally sensitive and environmentally responsible.\nIn summary, playground design in Australia is guided by a set of principles that prioritize the safety of children, inclusivity, accessibility, age appropriateness, natural elements, creative play, risk-taking, play value, and durability.\nBy following these principles, playgrounds can provide children with a safe, engaging, and stimulating play environment that promotes their physical, social, and emotional development.\n",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\nI managed a band of younger guys in my late 30s, and one of them said we should go skinny-dipping in my pool. If you read my other writing, youll know nudity is something I embraced a while earlier. I was game, but the youngest guy hesitated. I overheard one of them say to him, Come on! Well get to see Carols breasts.\nThey all seemed to approve of them. There was nothing overtly sexual, and we all just had a great time splashing around.\nMany people have seen my breasts. No, not necessarily what youre thinking, although I do have nude and topless pics floating around out there. Ive never been a stripper.\nI went braless most of my life starting in my 20s. So even people who havent actually seen my naked breasts have seen the outline of the nipples. I have very proud nipples. They point a little more toward the south these days, but they still announce their presence.\nMy breasts were tiny most of my life. At least by my estimation, and that of the guys who made fun of them, starting in high school. I was called Little Bits, and a member of the itty, bitty, titty committee.\nMaybe because they were small, I dont have a strong memory of when they arrived. Unlike those of you who woke up one day in your early teens or even preteens with breasts that belonged to a grown woman, not someone who still climbed trees.\nI know someone who got her large ones at camp one summer. When her dad went to pick her up, he told her, You put those back where you found them.\nI did have an inferiority complex about how small mine were when I was younger. It came from my mother, who felt the same about hers. What she and I should have done is be proud of our perky, perfectly shaped breasts.\nI wish Id had as strong an influence on her later in life about appreciating her body and beauty as she did on me in my early life of not appreciating them. My therapist and a couple of men who were vocal about their sincere appreciation helped me accept and love mine.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nI still wanted bigger ones, because in our western culture, especially during my teens and 20s, they were the ideal. In my 30s I fully accepted my smaller ones.\nThe year I turned 40 I got pregnant, something Id wanted but didnt think I could ever experience. With pregnancy came one more thing Id always wanted. I got large breasts.\nI used those larger breasts to breastfeed my son for nearly three years. When he was tiny, I did that in public and uncovered. I even did it while with my counseling supervisor getting my hours. He didnt complain.\nIm an earth mother and an earthy mother. I didnt want to give up the closeness, the immunity protection it gave him, or  to be totally real about it  my bigger breasts.\nFortunately, I kept them. It has been an adjustment back to wearing bras because while pregnant, breast feeding and after, I needed the support. Would I exchange these larger breasts for my earlier smaller ones now?\nI would, actually. Id love to go braless again. Bralessness could be managed with a gym routine to build up the chest muscles, and thats my plan. Im fine with the nipples. Losing my current weight might bring back smaller breasts and bralessness. Exercise and weight loss are good resolutions no matter what my breast size.\nSo who else has seen my breasts besides the boys in the band? Two friends in a sweat lodge, people on nude beaches on several French islands, and in Austin at Hippie Hollow.\nFolks in a hot tub in Colorado and in a communal shower after. More folks in a sauna in Aspen, Colorado. Women in a hot tub on the side of the mountain in Santa Fe, New Mexico at Ten Thousand Waves. Women in the wet area of a Korean spa in Texas. Friends in hot tubs in other places. Two friends with me in my jacuzzi bath. Everyone who helped me labor with my son past the first 10 hours. There were at least eight of them, not including nurses and doctors.\nLovers and husbands, of course. One of them took nude photos of me at age 50. One took photos of me in my 20s, but his subsequent wife threw them out, and since it was pre-internet they no longer exist. Im hoping Yael Wolfe will take some of me soon. For posterity and for fun. Who knows how many more people will see my breasts in this lifetime?\n\nThis post was previously published on MEDIUM.COM.\n",

Sometimes its a casual, You aint from around here, are you? to the downright vicious, Go back to your own country!\nBut what is it that drives some people crazy about outsiders arriving? (For the record, Im not one of them. Canada is built on newcomers.)\nMy first instinct was to do a little digging into our evolution. Not surprisingly, theres some evidence that humans (or at least our ancestors) are territorial. This is a common theme across the animal kingdom. This made sense back in prehistoric times, when resources werent able to be moved around as easily.\nIn other words, you had to be there in order to eat it. It made sense from a survival standpoint that we protected the food and water in our area until it ran dry.\nBut what about now, when food is shipped across the world, and we can buy bottles of water from almost any store? Does it still make sense for people to be xenophobic?\nNo. In fact, staying in one place for years or decades is actually counter to our evolution.\nWere historically more nomadic than sedentary\nThe notion that we are born and raised in one place is actually quite new  only about 12,000 years, says a\nBBC article\n. Before modern civilizations, we roamed around in tribes, looking for plants and animals to eat.\nWhen predators came into our territory, we left. (This is perhaps similar to refugees seeking new countries when their governments become oppressive. They are literally following the patterns of our ancient cousins.)\nHowever, somewhere deep in our history, we started seeing nomads as enemies. This, as the BBC points out, may be traced back to\n, who roamed around conquering other civilizations in the 13th century. This seems to have created the long-lasting idea that all who wander are looking to kill (or assimilate), but we should know by now from logic that isnt true.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nFrom my experience, those who arrive in Canada from other countries are often grateful for the opportunity, looking to learn about our diverse culture. Even if newcomers arent actively trying to integrate with our way of life (there isnt just one, as were a rich blend of cultures), they certainly havent been trying to steal my home.\nOne of the main arguments from newcomer naysayers is that they will take our jobs.\nYes, theyre taking jobs  the ones the rest of us dont want\nStatistics suggest that about\n27.7%\nof the Canadian workforce is made up of immigrants, up from 25.7% in 2016 according to The Globe and Mail. However, most true blood Canadians wouldnt ever have do the jobs they are complaining about losing.\nFrom truck and taxi driving to food prep and delivery, I see a lot of recent immigrants doing these kinds of service jobs, along with those who have been in this country for some time.\nAre newcomers taking over management positions at big companies? Well, I would say no, although the article notes that many immigrants are bringing a bachelors degree with them. However, just because immigrants may be qualified to work in higher-paying jobs, it doesnt mean its easy to get one that theyre trained for.\nIn fact, Canada recently rolled out provisions to\nand education\n.)\nThese same born-and-raised Canadians who whine about immigrants also complain about people on social assistance, saying stuff like no one wants to work. Well, its not that no one wants to work, sir  its that many of the jobs available here are gruelling, with little pay to compensate.\nThese could be called \n, as they put food on the table until a newcomer is able to find work they excel in. (This process can take a long time, if at all, as there are Canadian experience barriers.)\nThe West is literally built on immigration\nBorders are imaginary. There are no countries without humans saying so. The notion that we shouldnt be able to cross into another land without facing scrutiny (or much worse) is highly outdated.\nIf you dont have a job, dont blame immigrants. Its your own lack of skills, experience, or motivation. In fact, those complaining about no jobs could easily start their own venture, with all of the Canadian\ngovernment supports\nthat come with it. In fact, some of the newcomers to my neighbourhood have opened storefronts to create their own opportunities.\nAn AI-generated newcomer happy to be in Canada. I should mention that the AI generated four non-white people as samples of immigrants. This suggests a collective bias in the training data.\nIf you think youre not working because a newcomer from Syria or Iran or China or Ukraine or wherever took your dream job, youre delusional. If you think that taxes are going up because were giving big handouts to immigrants, youre sorely mistaken. There are provisions to help them get their footing here, but its short-term.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nYoure probably also racist, pure and simple. Many people think that Canada is a place that welcomes anybody  and Id like to believe that, as I did growing up. But sadly,\nas anywhere else. (My grandparents were white immigrants from Scotland, but to my knowledge, no one ever told them to go home.)\nIn the spirit of fairness,\nabout how immigration affects American workers. But notice that those most affected by lower wages from decades of record immigration are Black and Latino.\nAnti-immigration policies are counterproductive\nCanadian politics are shifting further to the right, and many conservatives dont take kindly to uninvited arrivals due to their distorted and outdated beliefs.\nWe should instead be welcoming newcomers with open arms, as they bring different viewpoints and skills, while helping companies compete on a more global level. Not to mention, they are doing a lot of the low-paying jobs like delivering food to our doors, and other minimum-wage or precarious gig work.\nTheyre also doing a lot of\nconstruction jobs\n, literally building our future (and past) infrastructure. So if youre mad about that, go buy a pair of steel-toed boots, and apply to a construction firm. Whats that? Youre too comfortable making $150 an hour as a consultant? Okay then.\nWe can see what happens when a country tries to close its doors, as in the failed case of",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\n\nWe surveyed 2,100+ professionals regarding their job change habits and frequency, in an attempt to answer two questions:\nHow often do people change jobs?\nWhy do people change jobs?\nBelow, well share our findings.\nHow Often do People Change Jobs?\nOn average, people change jobs every 2.73 years, or approximately every two years and nine months.\nBelow, youll find a more detailed breakdown of how often the average person changes jobs:\n42% changed jobs every one to two years.\n31% changed jobs every four years or more.\n23% changed jobs every three years.\n4% reported changing jobs more than once per year.\n62% of People Have Left a Job in the First Year\nWe also asked another simple question: Have you ever left a job within one year of starting? 62% of professionals reported leaving at least one job within the first year.\nSo while the average job tenure is 2.73 years, more than half of the professionals we polled left at least one job within a year.\nWhy Do People Change Jobs? Common Reasons\nNext, we asked about peoples reasons for leaving past jobs.\nThe most common reasons that people change jobs are finding a better opportunity, leaving a toxic environment, and a lack of room for professional growth.\nBelow, youll find the exact breakdown of the top reasons people leave jobs, based on the percentage of professionals who reported leaving a position for each reason at least once in their career:\n55% found a new, better job opportunity.\n43% indicated a toxic work environment/culture.\n41% indicated a lack of opportunities for professional growth in their current job.\n36% resigned due to being underpaid and/or not receiving salary raises.\n32% left due to a boss.\n30% left a job due to being laid off.\n30% wanted to change careers.\nLess-common reasons for leaving a position include the following:\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nBeing a family member of an active-duty service member and needing to relocate the family.\nA companys business needs shifting and the employees role changing without their desire to change.\nSeeking a better commute.\nWhat Percentage of People Change Careers?\n30% of the 2,100+ people in our survey changed careers at some point in their professional lives.\nThis is in line with my first-hand observations from working as a recruiter for five years; Ive observed that approximately one-third of professionals have made a career change in their professional lives.\nWhile its common to change careers, its still more common to stay within one industry and career path, since career change brings challenges, risks, and sometimes a temporary salary reduction.\nIf youre considering changing careers, research the career path and industry youre considering so you know what youre getting into, and then trust your gut and follow your instinct.\nEven though fewer than half of people change careers, I still recommend it in many cases\nChanging careers can bring you more room for upward growth, help you escape a shrinking/dying industry, and bring new excitement and passion to your work.\nSome of the more common industries that I see people changing into include software development and\nFor further career change statistics, I recommend this article by Apollo Technical.\nDo Younger Workers Change Jobs More Often?\nWe did not ask respondents to report their age in the polls mentioned above; however, as a former recruiter, my experience is that younger professionals do change jobs more often than older generations.\nOlder generations, like baby boomers, were told that job-hopping looks bad on a resume and that you should never leave a job within one year.\nIts becoming more acceptable to switch careers or take new jobs at a higher frequency, though.\nYounger professionals are realizing that if theyre sure they want a career change or new job, theres little sense in remaining in a position for a full year just to improve their resume.\nGood Reasons to Make a Job Change Immediately\nThe advice that you should stay in every job for at least one year is outdated and dangerous/harmful.\nThere are many reasons to start a job search or take a new job immediately.\nGood reasons for joining a new company/job immediately include:\nYour current job is taking a toll on your mental health.\nThe role changed and is different than what you wanted to do when you were hired.\nYouve been given a new, dream job opportunity and youll look back and regret it if you dont take the role.\nYouve been offered an opportunity that pays significantly more money, which will greatly improve your quality of life and financial situation.\nYouve decided to transition away from your current career to a new type of work.\nYoure relocating and your current role cannot be performed remotely.\nYour current employer is going through layoffs/downsizing and you dont want to take the risk of being laid off in the near future.\nThose are just some of the situations when you should change to a new position even if youve spent less than one year in your current role.\nLooking back on my own career, as someone who has changed careers multiple times, I dont regret any job changes. I regret staying in positions I was unhappy in.\nHowever, if your job isnt harming your physical or mental health, consider looking for a job while employed instead of quitting with no job lined up.\nContinuing in your same job will give you a steady paycheck and more confidence in your job hunt. Youll have less pressure and more time to look for the right new position.\nAlso, if you love your company but feel your role is no longer a fit, consider talking to your manager about whether this same company may have a different team/role that fits your goals better.\nHow Often is Too Often to Change Jobs?\nTo wrap up, Im going to help you decide: How often is too often to change jobs?\nThe answer depends on your total years of experience and other factors.\nEmployers look at your resume and job history as one big picture. They only see job-hopping as an issue if it seems to be a pattern.\nIf your average number of months in a position is 12-24+, thats good.\nThen, if you left one job in three months because you knew that it wasnt a good fit, thats fine.\nIn this case, you did the right thing by not wasting a full year in a role that you knew wasnt a fit!\nSo the key here is to be strategic and limit how often youre doing this. Pick and choose the scenarios when it makes sense to make quick job changes, and when its not worth it.\nDont like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nBut do take that better job, or leave that toxic environment ASAP when needed.\nTry to keep your average number of months in each position at 12-24 or above, and youll be unlikely to scare off any potential employers even if youve left one or two positions in less than a year.\n\nThis post was previously published on Career Sidekick.\n***\nJoin The Good Men Project as a Premium Member today.\nAll Premium Members get to view The Good Men Project with NO ",
